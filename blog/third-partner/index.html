<div class="entry-content"><p>Now that you have <em>many</em> <a href="/blog/second-partner">second partners</a>, it is time to introduce
your third partner.  Unfortunately your third partner is as socially inept as your first, but
it is much better at one thing: giving you feedback on your serve.</p>

<p>Some people do serve to their <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a>, but the information you get
back is not very useful.  And the wall is missing a number of critical things that I and John (my coach)
think you should be learning.  The only advantage that the wall provides vs. your third partner is
balls come back to you, so you don&rsquo;t need very many balls at all.  Later in this post, I will solve
that problem for you and enable you to carry almost a dozen balls!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Your third partner is the tennis court itself without anyone on the other side.  Serving is a very solitary thing.
You don&rsquo;t need a partner, an opponent, or any spectators.  You just need you vs. the court.  Serving is all
under <em>your</em> control, so blot out all the rest.  Improve your serve week after week and you will someday be a terror
to many of your opponents.  Being aced does not boost your ego!</p>

<p>OK, so to serve you stand on the baseline and hit the ball over the net right?  NO!  Go back a couple blogs and find <a href="/blog/model">your model</a>,
and then watch how they serve.  You can change models for your serve vs. other strokes.  Heck you can have a different model for each
stroke.  But you <em>must</em> have a model.  Try to copy the model, and as you do, your individuality will emerge.  And emerge with
an <em>awesome</em> serve vs. a &lsquo;that is what everyone does&rsquo; serve.</p>

<h2>I am not a coach</h2>

<p>OK, so you are watching your model, imagining you serve like that, and maybe you have a coach/instructor that can give you feedback.
You are on your way, and can skip to the &lsquo;Balls&rsquo; section if happy.  Again, I am <em>not a coach</em>.  At this point, I will be relaying
things that work for me, or were told to me by John.  But what John tells me is different from what John tells other students,
so I have no idea if what I am going to relay to you will be useful to you.  But it will at least show the thought and later the
originality that goes into having an awesome serve!</p>

<p>My model for serving is Federer.  Or at least it was when I started and before John started tweaking me.  Federer has an
amazing serve when he is <em>on</em>.  Very fast.  Very controlled.  He has a flat and a topspin.  Tends to use the topspin for his
second serve.  And there is tons of video on him serving.</p>

<p>I wanted Federer&rsquo;s serve.  Or the closest I could get to it.  And that <em>is all</em> I wanted.  Month-after-month I would practice this serve.
On my own, I got better and better.  Finally with John, I started to clinch it: I had an amazingly fast (for a club player) flat serve.
Today I clocked it at 85MPH to the net.  That means it likely left my racket (40 feet earlier) at over 100MPH.  Crazy!</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t learn to serve like that in one blog entry, so this entry will be about &ldquo;The Court&rdquo; and your relationship to it.  This
is from John, so it is fairly &lsquo;recent&rsquo; to me but it was months ago.  Nicely it involves pictures :&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Targeting Rackets</h2>

<p>If you look at a court from the baseline it looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_9219_h1224.jpg"/></p>

<p>That is actually incredibly <em>un-useful</em>.  Don&rsquo;t look at the court like that ever again after today.</p>

<p>With one image, I will send you on your way.  Here we go:</p>
