##The Slums of Palo Alto <small>[^1]</small>

[^1]: _How to be ecstatically happy after ten failed startups_

The putting green on the balcony overlooked Santa Monica pier.  We were in the suite previously owned by Lawrence Welk, and could watch the taping of Bay Watch every Monday.  During the day it was incredibly beautiful… it was the first of a series of too beautiful to believe buildings that would affect my life.  At night it was a bit scary.  We were building a news palace for a Saudi Prince.  Saudi Princes have a lot of enemies, and when working at night in our beautiful offices it felt like all the enemies of our Prince were figuring out ways to get to me.  Rappel down from the balcony above?  Sneak past the security cameras protecting the elevator?  Apparently the prince was convinced by the Iraq war that CNN was a more reliable way to know what was going on around his country than other means, and he needed a palace of news to make sure he wasn’t about to be overthrown or worse.  I never saw the elevator pitch, but it could have been “Keep your neck with a palace of news”.

This was the first of many startups that I was to be a part of.  A total of ten startups.  To quickly get rid of any chance of romance… all of them failed.  A couple earned my family some amount of money, but those earnings were little more than a yearly bonus.  A couple cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost wages.  And when I was at the helm: I managed to lose approximately one million dollars of my own and my friends money.  All of these startups played major havoc with my life and my health, with my wife and my children.  For a decade I felt that we could be evicted almost instantly: my wife and two daughters on the street at a moments notice.

But after venturing through a total of ten failed startups, I am amongst the happiest people you will ever meet.  I have an amazing family whom I totally love.  I can make amazing things happen for people who I love deeply or even barely know.  I am now “Neo” and having taken the red pill can now interact with the world in ways I could never imagine as a confident but shy teenager.  I don’t know why I am here, but I totally know _that_ I am here.  And if I am here, I am going to make things happen.  Amazing things.  For anyone and everyone.

My family and I rent a house in Palo Alto.  The cheaper part of Palo Alto, where lawns are unkempt and foreign investors buy a house and leave it vacant year round.  We are in the slums.  Not because our house is cheap.  It is worth approximately one point five million dollars.  If you live in Palo Alto you normally use single or two digit numbers to refer to house prices.  The million is implied.  But our house is very poorly made: it is cold and hot on those rare days that Palo Alto is either cold or hot.  We lose the phone and Internet connection on those rare days it rains in Palo Alto.  And what makes us truly in the slums: on any day we could be evicted for being unable to make the monthly payment of five thousand dollars. We are totally in the slums… it just happens that these slums are in the opulent heart of Silicon Valley.

### Failure: Most Epic

My most epic failure was also my fastest.  It lasted only a minute or two.

Earlier in the evening Rebecca and I had dinner with our families.  It was the night before we formally walked: graduated from Caltech.  Graduating from Caltech was not easy for either of us, so this was a significant event.  I believe we were incredibly happy.

Rebecca had a cat named Houdini.  She had found her as a stray, washed her up, and out popped a beautiful Norwegian Forest cat.  She was amazingly smart and friendly too.  Amongst the best cats I have ever had or seen.  Houdini got her name “Harriet Houdini” based on her ability to escape from closed rooms.  A friend was staying in a house near Caltech and Rebecca sometimes kept the cat at that person’s house.  Houdini would be in a room with closed windows and a closed door, but magically she would escape and appear outside the house.  This happened many times.  The friend swore he did not let her out.  Hence the name.  Decades later the friend recanted.

But the night of graduation, Houdini was staying in Rebecca’s mother’s condo in Chino.  Rebecca had been staying there for maybe half a year or so.  And given Houdini was there, Rebecca had to go back to feed her.  Most of Rebecca’s clothes were there too.  So after dinner, Rebecca, the love of my life, departed to Chino.  It took a bit less than an hour to get there.

An hour or two later I get a call from Rebecca.  It is maybe 11PM or midnight, the night before our graduation.  I was a night owl, so I was awake but I was definitely surprised by the call.  I believe Rebecca said something like “Can you come and get me?” She may have also said, “I am in the hospital”, but I don’t remember.  I know the right answer to that question today, but the two-minute epic failure of my life involved me saying things like “What are you talking about?”, “You are an hour away”, and “It is graduation night”.  The only right answer then was “Yes, I will be right there!”  Not saying those simple words immediately is my life’s crowning failure.

Rebecca had been assaulted at knifepoint in her condo’s carport.  Whether the person wanted just money or something worse, we will never know.  Rebecca screamed and somewhat surprisingly grabbed the knife.  By the blade! Amazingly this reaction scared the perpetrator off.  A call to 911 and Rebecca was to the hospital.  She was calling me from there, after having survived a mugging at knifepoint.  Again, my life’s crowning failure.  And one I immediately committed to never even getting close to again.  To never fail her again.

We walked and graduated the next day.  Rebecca’s finger was bandaged to protect the deep wound and it’s stitching.  We were both very tired, but very happy.  We have rarely been apart since then.  It is 30 years later.

### Three

I worked as a contractor and consultant for several years, and then stopped working shortly before my first daughter was born.  About a year and a half later, a friend and coworker asked me if I could help them out.  The company was Evant, earlier named Retail Aspect.

Evant was in the process of landing Staples with their product: a multidimensional retail planning application.  If you take a retailer like The Gap, they have to plan what clothes they will have in the store for each month of the year.  They can use previous years to help their predictions, but each year new styles and colors come out, so it is somewhat a magical art to get the inventories right.  Planning tools help the planners work with huge amounts of historical data, huge numbers of stores, and huge number of items.  The planners want quick responses as the transform the plans for the entire fleet of stores.  I forget what Staples store count was, but The Gap has about two thousand stores, so Staples is probably similar.  Two thousand stores, maybe a thousand products, various variations on the products, and planning at the day or week level.  For each product there could be several dozen metrics.  And we also have several years worth of historical data at the item level.  So in total the planning application has to work with billions of data points… at the least.

So Staples loved the Evant product.  Very leading edge UI, flexible planning engine capabilities, etc.  Looked good to go forward into actual production use.  Except for a “little problem”.  The problem was the planning product was a prototype.  And written by someone no longer with the company.  And among the things it could do, dealing with a billion points of data was not one of them.  So it was a very simple request: could I turn the prototype into the real thing.  In about three months.

### Coffee

I did not drink coffee at all until after college.  After college, at some point Rebecca and I found a great bakery and coffee shop on the edge of what became the shopping section of Pasadena called “Old Pasadena”.  Originally this section of town was _very seedy_, and certain kinds of stores (the kind that Rebecca and I would be unlikely to frequent) actually lasted a very long time through the gentrification of the section.  The bakery was at the end, was nice and airy, and looked out over the gorge that now holds the 710.  They served coffee in bowls.  It was very good, and I might partake in a mocha once a week.

When Rebecca and I joined OOCL (Orient Overseas Container Lines) to work on a large Smalltalk project, I think I started drinking a bit more coffee.  May have been just a ritual, and I am not sure whether it was even a daily ritual.  I know I was a lightweight in the coffee arena.  One day I went to a new coffee shop that does two shots by default.  I was _wired_ that day, and made sure to call the shots (1) in the future.

The Evant project changed all that.  I had been home with my wife and Maya for at least 18 months.  I mountain biked several times a week, up some serious mountains.  I had plenty of money in the bank, so I didn’t need to work at all… at least for a while longer.  I liked my life.

I also liked the Evant challenge laid before me.  And the Evant team already had several of my friends in it: two were at my wedding.  And the new people I met, I immediately liked them too.  I wanted _both lives_.  _Concurrently_.

Turns out, you can do that.  You simply multi-task at some proper unit of granularity.  I picked by the day.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I would go into Evant and work my but off.  The other four days I would keep my family life.  Maybe responding to an email or doing some work at home, but definitely not at work.  To get what needed to be done, actually done in the timeline we were talking about, was not a part-time task.  It was a normal 40+ hours a week kind of task.  So I worked 12-14 hours each day I went in.  Arrive around 7AM.  Leave at 9PM.  Rarely had lunch.  Really only consumed one kind of food.

There was a Starbucks on the ground floor of the Evant building.

I am no longer a lightweight.

### Slums

To be clear, I am not claiming that Palo Alto has parts that are like the slums of Rio De Janeiro or Kolkata.  At worse, we have (or had) a trailer park, which was probably much safer and cleaner than most of the next town over.  And we have a strange part of Palo Alto that does not go to the Palo Alto school district.  But Mountain View is a perfectly good school district, and people like Salman Khan and the Crittenden principle are making it better by the day.

By slums I mean a place where (a) people are living an appreciably worse standard of living then those around them, (b) those people have no economic power to make their life significantly better without “emigrating”, (c) people’s health and happiness are meaningfully impacted, and (d) there is imminent threat of things getting much worse.

If my definition is so irreconcilable with yours that you must stop reading, I understand.  If you have not bought the book yet, please put it back on the shelf.  If you did, it may be a good white elephant gift.

If you are still here: Rebecca and I did not actually move into the slums.  They came to us…    [More](/more)
