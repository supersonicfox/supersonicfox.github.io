I have been writing a book http://slumsofpaloalto.com/ and playing a lot of tennis.  The tennis was a major part of
how I transformed in the last year, and may have been a major enabler for writing the book.  Losing 40 pounds of fat, gaining 10+ of muscle,
and having an insanely fun & social activity may have been major catalysts for my transformation.  The book will cover some of what
happened with tennis, but it has a lot of topics in it, and it is mostly about learning & kindness repeatedly being applied after
repeated failures.  This site and blog will focus just on tennis, hoping to help others be better players, and told from
a somewhat elderly, not super-fit (at the start), but definitely committed player.  Not a professional tennis player, but a professional _learner_ who
applied those skills to tennis.

I hope it helps someone else have a little better (or a lot better) of a game, while still having an insanely fun time playing.
