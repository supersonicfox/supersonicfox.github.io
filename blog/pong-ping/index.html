<div class="entry-content"><p>This site is meant to be primarily about Tennis, and more accidentally about other things.
But today I had a conversation that is more about other things and only somewhat about tennis,
so I guess this post stretches the boundary of this blog a bit.</p>

<h2>Insanity</h2>

<p>Insanity is doing things that you have enough evidence to know <em>will not work</em> but yet you still do them.
That should be the only good definition of the word: you try something, it fails, you try again, it fails, yet
you keep doing exactly the same thing expecting it to succeed.  That is a useful word
and would be helpful to most of the planet if they learned it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most people prefer a different definition of insanity, which is basically equivalent to &ldquo;Not like &lsquo;normal&rsquo; people&rdquo;.
This is not a very useful concept because it is pejorative.  &ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo; good word.  &ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo; good word.  &ldquo;Insane!&rdquo; meaning not normal&hellip; useless negative word.
Unless you consider it to be a humbler version of the two definitions preceding it.</p>

<p>So now that I have explained my understanding of the word &ldquo;insane&rdquo;, I will actually accept my last definition and say simply &ldquo;I am insane&rdquo;.
I do things <em>very differently</em> from &lsquo;normal&rsquo; people.  My insanity makes my incredibly productive.  Beyond most
people&rsquo;s conception of &lsquo;productive&rsquo;.</p>

<p>You may or may not want to follow my lead, but I have now committed to explaining it.</p>

<h2>Pong-Ping</h2>

<p>If you have read my book <a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/</a>, you know a bit about the sequences of startups I have participated in.  The first four were relatively
soft participations in the management, the fifth was my own (lost a lot of money), and the sixth through tenth were me trying
to focus on executing what I was clearly good at while learning a bit more about the other aspects of the company.</p>

<p>For the first of these five, I joined Jerry Kaplan (<a href="http://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=jerry+kaplan">http://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=jerry+kaplan</a>) at his startup <a href="http://winster.com">http://winster.com</a>.
There are different kinds of Entrepreneurs, and Jerry would commonly be called an &lsquo;Optimizer&rsquo;.  This is a very useful skill
when things are running very smoothly, so a lot of Jerry&rsquo;s skills would help you have a more optimized life.</p>

<p>One of the critical things Entrepreneurs have to do is <em>raise money</em>.  Potentially lots of money ideally from people you barely know,
so these people need to investigate you quite a bit before deciding to give you money.  And these people are commonly very busy.
Some could take months to get back to you (even when you are Jerry), so you have to be patient.  Also these people do not like
to be &lsquo;pestered&rsquo;, so you don&rsquo;t have to poke them many times.  Poke once and then wait.  Poke many different people to hopefully get
a positive response from someone.</p>

<p>You might consider this to be &lsquo;Ping&rsquo; them and they &lsquo;Pong&rsquo; you back.  So it is a game of Ping-Pong.</p>

<p>But that is not optimal <em>if</em> there are many interactions with these people.  Or it makes the rhythm misleading for the truly optimal
interaction.  Any time you get a &lsquo;Pong&rsquo; you should ASAP &lsquo;Ping&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Pong&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;Ping&rsquo;&hellip; pong-ping&hellip;.. pong-ping&hellip;. pong-ping&hellip;</p>

<p>If you rush as soon as you get a Pong, the other person has the ball again and it is up to them to Pong you again.  There is
now <em>nothing</em> you can do&hellip; which is incredibly relieving.</p>

<h2>Pong-Ping <em>everything</em></h2>

<p>I gave the VC cycle as an example, but this actually works for <em>absolutely</em> everything that needs to get done.  Consider
any request from someone this way and you can get it out of your hair (or brain) almost instantly.  I was recently contacted
by McDonalds and responded within five minutes.  It was a completely composed response, which would have been hard for me
to do that quickly a couple decades ago, but the core process was identical:</p>

<ul>
<li> Receive Pong</li>
<li> Read Pong</li>
<li> Decide whether to kill the Pong (trash it)</li>
<li> If going to Ping, do it immediately.  Might take a day or two.  Or you might have to break it into smaller tasks and do one then <em>pong yourself</em></li>
</ul>


<p>And you are done.  It really works for pretty much everything and means you have nothing looming over you undone.  Everything is done, pinged, and you are free to
get new Pongs.  Even from yourself :&ndash;)</p>

<p>The site <a href="http://FixYourMom.com">http://FixYourMom.com</a> went from idea conceived at the lunch table to live in less than four hours based on Pong-Ping!  And during that time I was mostly doing other things!</p>
