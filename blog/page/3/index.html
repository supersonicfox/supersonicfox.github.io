  <div class="entry-content"><p>Again, what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo; is someone who plays tennis with other people.  Your <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a> is very reliable but
not very communicative or varied.  Given a particular shot from you, they always do the same thing.
So we should augment your first partner so you have a bit more diversity and a bit more social interaction.  But you also want
reliability.  So who should your second partner be?</p>

<p>Ideally, you are in a nice tennis community.  Very social.  Very inclusive.  Not terribly serious.  Lots of tennis being played everyday.  If you
are, your second partner will be a bit better than if you are in a less active or less inclusive community.  If you are in the Palo Alto area, simply go to <a href="http://tennispaloalto.com/">http://tennispaloalto.com/</a> to see what social and inclusive meetups are
occurring near you.  If you are somewhere else, try to find out that information from your local tennis shop, library, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have two trainers now.  One is my &ldquo;Tennis Coach&rdquo; (John), and one is my &ldquo;Physical Trainer&rdquo; (Steve).  They
are both awesome and focus on different things for me.  John is getting me to play better by mostly focusing on technique,
and Steve is helping me play better and not injure myself by mostly focusing on my muscles and conditioning.  Steve is
relatively new to me, but we have had one evaluation session, and one real session.  So by this point, I can guess where
things are going :&ndash;)</p>

<p>An important thing about trainers, coaches, and mentors, is you have to <em>trust them</em> and <em>do exactly as they say</em>.  You need
to leave your ego at the door.  You are not the coach.  You are not the trainer.  You do not know what to do, or if you are
so sure of yourself, just walk back out of that door.  And stop wasting your money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I wrote the first version of <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a> (the MVB), my aunt sent me a very interesting article.
It was about &lsquo;Focus&rsquo; and two mildly successful people: Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.  You can read it <a href="http://qz.com/231907/why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-are-so-successful-in-one-word/">Here</a>.</p>

<p>Accidentally, this posting will do the same thing with the word &lsquo;Progress&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Progress&rsquo; is both <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Progress+definition">a verb and a noun</a>.
And for you to succeed with the noun &ldquo;Make progress&rdquo;, you must succeed with the verb &ldquo;Progress&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About nine or ten months into my transformation, I was hitting serves and ground-strokes at about 90 MPH.  &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
Yes, really.  You can ask my partners, but more objectively you can ask my Go Pro Hero.  The Go Pro is a
wide angle, 120 FPS, video camera.  It has other abilities too, but for tennis, this particular mode will
be the most important for you.  If you don&rsquo;t have a Go Pro Hero, try to borrow one from someone, or stop
by my courts and I will tape you.</p>

<p>Again, about ten months in, I had video confirming the 90 MPH speeds.  Of course, if I am serving at 90 MPH the
obvious question is &ldquo;How do I serve at 120 MPH?&rdquo;  At least, that is the obvious question to me :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Previously I said I could provide nothing to help you determine &ldquo;What should I actually be practicing?&rdquo;  That
was a lie, but it was important to get out of the way: <em>you</em> are responsible for what you should be practicing.
Coaches, friends, random strangers, and so on can suggest things you should be practicing.  They may be right
or wrong (I have had a lot of unsolicited suggestions in the last year, some of which were actually useful),
but you must practice, so it is up to you to decide &lsquo;what&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t have a lot of insight into &lsquo;what&rsquo; you should be practicing, but based on the last year, I do
have one piece of advice: Pick a Model.</p>

<p>Pick some pro in the top 500 of men or women who you want to be like.  Then imagine you play like them.  Start
studying their playing style, look at slow motion of their strokes, imagine that your muscles worked like theirs.
And practice <em>that</em>.  Twelve hours a week (or more&hellip; or less).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So now that you have said &ldquo;hello&rdquo; a few times to your first partner (if not, please go back one blog),
you might be wondering &ldquo;What should I actually be practicing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this blog will not give you specifics on that.  You need to be practicing lots of things.  And
if your partner is a wall, you need to understand how to practice against a wall.  So google these things and
read what USPTA coaches write on the web, or get a USPTA coach to train you on improving your strokes, or go
to a few tennis clinics and see what they say you should work on.  Or if you play at Mitchell and let me watch
you, I (not a USPTA coach) might make suggestions.  Or I will grab my coach (John Chan) to look at you.
But I believe there is nothing I can write on this blog
that will help you with the &lsquo;what&rsquo;.  Sorry.</p>

<p>But if you know the &lsquo;what&rsquo;, I will help you with the &lsquo;how&rsquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I commonly refer to everyone with whom I play tennis as my &lsquo;partner&rsquo;.  I have no opponents, just partners who are either
on the same side of the net, or partners on the opposite of the net.  This may be because we switch up
the matches quite a bit, or because I appreciate their help when we warm up, or just because I am a friendly guy
who does not really want any opponents.  Whatever the reason, that is what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo;: someone who plays tennis
with other people.</p>

<p>If you want to get good at tennis, you need to find a good partner.  And however good you are, your first partner
needs to match your abilities as they are today, and how good they will be in a couple months of serious practice (yes, I
said &lsquo;serious practice&rsquo;&hellip; you are serious aren&rsquo;t you?).</p>

<p>That is a tall order for this first partner to fill.  But amazingly, your first partner will be even better than just
this tall order.  Your first partner will be amazingly reliable and incredibly consistent.  If you don&rsquo;t play tennis
today, it was because <em>you</em> chose not to play and get better.  Seven days a week, your partner will be ready.  You might
have to drive a bit to meet up, but that drive or walk is to tennis courts, and given you are a tennis player that
is expected of you.  And you may have to meet up early in the day or your first partner could be busy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that my daughter and I had equipment, we needed just a couple more things.  Courts and Time.</p>

<p>We live within walking distance of Mitchell Park in Palo Alto.  Mitchell has amazing tennis courts!  They clean themselves
every day magically.  They are right next to backboards so people can warm up and then join games.  There are a fair number
of them (seven) and within an easy walk there are six more.  And the tennis players at Mitchell are amongst the friendliest
you will ever encounter.  I am happy to now be counted among this elite community and to be expanding its reach every week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To play tennis, you  need equipment.  I grew up with tennis in the 1970s and 1980s.  By the time I was &ldquo;serious&rdquo; about tennis,
I played with Head Professional aluminum rackets.  I loved them: indestructible unless you were ridiculously mad at the court.  Until
2013, &ldquo;Red Heads&rdquo; were my only kind of racket:  Tiny, stiff, and indestructible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been writing a book <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a> and playing a lot of tennis.  The tennis was a major part of
how I transformed in the last year, and may have been a major enabler for writing the book.  Losing 40 pounds of fat, gaining 10+ of muscle,
and having an insanely fun &amp; social activity may have been major catalysts for my transformation.  The book will cover some of what
happened with tennis, but it has a lot of topics in it, and it is mostly about learning &amp; kindness repeatedly being applied after
repeated failures.  This site and blog will focus just on tennis, hoping to help others be better players, and told from
a somewhat elderly, not super-fit (at the start), but definitely committed player.  Not a professional tennis player, but a professional <em>learner</em> who
applied those skills to tennis.</p>

<p>I hope it helps someone else have a little better (or a lot better) of a game, while still having an insanely fun time playing.</p>
