<div class="entry-content"><p>Now that you have <em>many</em> <a href="/blog/second-partner">second partners</a>, it is time to introduce
your third partner.  Unfortunately your third partner is as socially inept as your first, but
it is much better at one thing: giving you feedback on your serve.</p>

<p>Some people do serve to their <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a>, but the information you get
back is not very useful.  And the wall is missing a number of critical things that I and John (my coach)
think you should be learning.  The only advantage that the wall provides vs. your third partner is
balls come back to you, so you don&rsquo;t need very many balls at all.  Later I will solve
that problem for you and enable you to carry almost a dozen balls!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Your third partner is the tennis court itself without anyone on the other side.  Serving is a very solitary thing.
You don&rsquo;t need a partner, an opponent, or any spectators.  You just need you vs. the court.  Serving is all
under <em>your</em> control, so blot out all the rest.  Improve your serve week after week and you will someday be a terror
to many of your opponents.  Acing people tends to deflate their egos!</p>

<p>OK, so to serve you stand on the baseline and hit the ball over the net right?  NO!  Go back a couple blogs and find <a href="/blog/model">your model</a>,
and then watch how they serve.  You can change models for your serve vs. other strokes.  Heck you can have a different model for each
stroke.  But you <em>must</em> have a model.  Try to copy the model, and as you do, your individuality will emerge.  And emerge with
an <em>awesome</em> serve vs. a &lsquo;that is what everyone does&rsquo; serve.</p>

<h2>I am not a coach</h2>

<p>OK, so you are watching your model, imagining you serve like that, and maybe you have a coach/instructor that can give you feedback.
You are on your way, and can merrily skip to the next blog entry if you are content.</p>

<p>If not content, read on, but remember, I am <em>not a coach</em>.  At this point, I will be relaying
things that work for me, or were told to me by John.  But what John tells me is different from what John tells other students,
so I have no idea if what I am going to relay to you will be useful to you.  But it will at least show the thought and later the
originality that goes into having an awesome serve!</p>

<p>My model for serving is Federer.  Or at least it was when I started and before John started tweaking me.  Federer has an
amazing serve when he is <em>on</em>.  Very fast.  Very controlled.  He has a flat and a topspin.  Tends to use the topspin for his
second serve.  And there is tons of video on him serving.</p>

<p>I wanted Federer&rsquo;s serve.  Or the closest I could get to it.  And that <em>is all</em> I wanted.  Month-after-month I would practice this serve.
On my own, I got better and better.  Finally with John, I started to clinch it: I had an amazingly fast (for a club player) flat serve.
Today I clocked it at 85MPH to the net.  That means it likely left my racket (40 feet earlier) at over 100MPH.  Crazy!</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t learn to serve like that in one blog entry, so this entry will be about &ldquo;The Court&rdquo; and your relationship to it.  This
is from John, so it is fairly &lsquo;recent&rsquo; to me but it was months ago.  Nicely it involves pictures :&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Targeting Rackets</h2>

<p>If you look at a court from the baseline it looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_9219_h1224.jpg"/></p>

<p>That is actually incredibly <em>un-useful</em>.  Don&rsquo;t look at the court like that ever again after today.</p>

<p>With one image, I will send you on your way.  Here we go:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_9222_h1224.jpg"/></p>

<p>What!  There are rackets in the net!  Who left those things there?  Well, John and I put those things there, and next to
the racket in your hands, those are the most <em>awesome</em> rackets on the planet!  At least to you.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are two rackets.  Why two?  Because one is for singles (the left) and one is for doubles (the right).
If you consider the picture, we are clearly standing near the center of the court, and so are likely playing singles.
For singles, you position the &ldquo;target racket&rdquo; approximately 3.5 racket lengths from center.</p>

<p>So do something like that on your third-partner and now try to hit that racket!  Look at it before you start your service motion.
Stare.  Then start.  Then hit or don&rsquo;t hit that racket.  That part isn&rsquo;t actually very important.  That racket
is your <em>bearings</em>.  It reminds you &ldquo;I am in a singles position&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am serving in the deuce court&rdquo;, and &ldquo;That court has a
particular shape relative to that target racket&rdquo;.  That is all.  But for the fun of it, keep trying to hit it.</p>

<p>If you do, you will find it very unrewarding :&ndash;(  Because the ball comes back to you :&ndash;/</p>

<p>(To be continued)</p>
