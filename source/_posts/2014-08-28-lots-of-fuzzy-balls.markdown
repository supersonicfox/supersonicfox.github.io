Today I am going to reveal my most incredibly genius complete transformation of the planes of reality... just for
you!

First some context.  In tennis, you need to hit fuzzy tennis balls.  Sometimes you hit the ball where you want it to go,
and the other person hits it back to you.  That is called a rally.  If all you ever do in your tennis life is 'rally',
my incredible genius is not meant for you.

But in certain circumstances in tennis, you either (a) don't hit the ball where your partner is, or (b) you or your
partner don't really hit the ball well at all.  So if either of these happen to you, you need to either go chasing after
that wayward ball, or have a brother/sister-ball easily available.

I value my and your time very highly, so I don't like chasing wayward fuzzy balls.  Instead I carry sibling balls with
me to stand in their elders' place: primus, secondus, ... septimus, and onward.  Wait did I just say 'septimus'?  That is
seven right?  Nobody carries seven balls!  Well, except me.  And as of today, I will teach you to as well.

The tennis industry is a bit backward.  Men are allowed to maybe carry four balls, plus one in their hand if they have a
single handed backhand (Hah!).  Women are apparently still meant to torture themselves with various bizarre "stashes" or
equipment just to carry one ball out-of-hand.  The tennis fashion industry is clearly seriously demented.

So look elsewhere for salvation.  Where?  Biking!  Yoga!  Walking!  All these other industries can make tennis more fun and
functional for you.

If you are a 'guy' (or 'dude' or 'mensch' or an awesome woman who is also flexible with her clothing), you can actually acquire
some Fila or similar
tennis pants.  Later I will let you know what should be under those pants (and no, it isn't 'underwear'... and no, it isn't
'commando' either... but that is a different topic for a differnt day).  OK, so you have pants that can now carry four balls.
Huzzah!

Now for the seven.  Well, actually, the dozen!  Instead of buying a silly tennis shirt, go buy a 3-pocket biking shirt.
These shirts are both totally suitable for tennis, and by having _three_ pockets, they can carry _six_ balls.  Four in the
pants, six in the shirt, and two in your left hand.  With one in play, you have a baker's dozen.
Burdened with a two-handed backhand?  Terrible penalty!  You are down to _ten_ balls plus
the one in play.  A "two-handed dozen"?

Playing with ten to a baker's dozen balls is a very different experience.  Much more time hitting with your partners.
Much more productive and less chase-y.  And totally
suitable for _serving_ without having the overhead of a ball-hopper.

You are the ball hopper!

### Women

If you are a woman and don't want to buy men's clothes to get pockets (Tennis industry dementia), apparently LuluLemon and likely
similar clothing lines are happy to provide 2-4 ball pockets in their pants and skirts.  So go buy them and tell your
local tennis shop that "I went elsewhere because tennis clothes are 'obsolete'".  That might get the manufacturers attention!

### My Outfit

I was going to post my outfit today, but I think I will save that for a blog
"What does the Fox wear?  The Supersonic Fox wear?" ;-)
