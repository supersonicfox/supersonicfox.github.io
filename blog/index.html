  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of doing <a href="http://insanelyGreatTennis.com/">Insanely Great Tennis</a> for the local pros of Palo Alto,
I came up with the idea of pitching a franchise to <a href="http://google.com/search?q=SharkTank">Shark Tank</a>.  To
pitch a television show, you need a picture of yourself.  I had my standard Linked-In profile, but that isn&rsquo;t really
very compelling.  So I augmented my pitch with my tennis outfits, so it is a good time to blog about them :&ndash;)</p>

<p>My outfits came out of two issues:</p>

<p>   a I frequently played tennis after biking (I biked with my kids to school, and then biked some more after).
   b To play tennis, you need <a href="/blog/lots-of-fuzzy-balls">Lots of fuzzy balls</a></p>

<p>With this two issues came my <em>amazing epiphany</em>: you should play tennis in biking shirts!  And by <em>you</em>, I really mean
<em>you</em>&hellip; as in everyone&hellip;. if you are reading this&hellip; go change your shirt and go play some tennis :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Another constraint on my outfits and clothing in general is that I do not want to think about clothing very much.  So
I have suits.  My primary suits involve a red shirt and black pants.  Sometimes I swap in a black shirt.  That is it.
Two choices.  Mostly affected by the contents of the hamper.</p>

<p>Below you will see four outfits, which were initially just one, but broadened somewhat when the second and especially the
third came along.  And the fourth was actually the original &ldquo;biking shirt&rdquo;, but it has only one rear pocket, so I now
just keep it around as a dry spare.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I am going to reveal my most incredibly genius complete transformation of the planes of reality&hellip; just for
you!</p>

<p>First some context.  In tennis, you need to hit fuzzy tennis balls.  Sometimes you hit the ball where you want it to go,
and the other person hits it back to you.  That is called a rally.  If all you ever do in your tennis life is &lsquo;rally&rsquo;,
my incredible genius is not meant for you.</p>

<p>But in certain circumstances in tennis, you either (a) don&rsquo;t hit the ball where your partner is, or (b) you or your
partner don&rsquo;t really hit the ball well at all.  So if either of these happen to you, you need to either go chasing after
that wayward ball, or have a brother/sister-ball easily available.</p>

<p>I value my and your time very highly, so I don&rsquo;t like chasing wayward fuzzy balls.  Instead I carry sibling balls with
me to stand in their elders&#8217; place: primus, secondus, &hellip; septimus, and onward.  Wait did I just say &lsquo;septimus&rsquo;?  That is
seven right?  Nobody carries seven balls!  Well, except me.  And as of today, I will teach you to as well.</p>

<p>The tennis industry is a bit backward.  Men are allowed to maybe carry four balls, plus one in their hand if they have a
single handed backhand (Hah!).  Women are apparently still meant to torture themselves with various bizarre &ldquo;stashes&rdquo; or
equipment just to carry one ball out-of-hand.  The tennis fashion industry is clearly seriously demented.</p>

<p>So look elsewhere for salvation.  Where?  Biking!  Yoga!  Walking!  All these other industries can make tennis more fun and
functional for you.</p>

<p>If you are a &lsquo;guy&rsquo; (or &lsquo;dude&rsquo; or &lsquo;mensch&rsquo; or an awesome woman who is also flexible with her clothing), you can actually acquire
some Fila or similar
tennis pants.  Later I will let you know what should be under those pants (and no, it isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;underwear&rsquo;&hellip; and no, it isn&rsquo;t
&lsquo;commando&rsquo; either&hellip; but that is a different topic for a differnt day).  OK, so you have pants that can now carry four balls.
Huzzah!</p>

<p>Now for the seven.  Well, actually, the dozen!  Instead of buying a silly tennis shirt, go buy a 3-pocket biking shirt.
These shirts are both totally suitable for tennis, and by having <em>three</em> pockets, they can carry <em>six</em> balls.  Four in the
pants, six in the shirt, and two in your left hand.  With one in play, you have a baker&rsquo;s dozen.
Burdened with a two-handed backhand?  Terrible penalty!  You are down to <em>ten</em> balls plus
the one in play.  A &ldquo;two-handed dozen&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Playing with ten to a baker&rsquo;s dozen balls is a very different experience.  Much more time hitting with your partners.
Much more productive and less chase-y.  And totally
suitable for <em>serving</em> without having the overhead of a ball-hopper.</p>

<p>You are the ball hopper!</p>

<h3>Women</h3>

<p>If you are a woman and don&rsquo;t want to buy men&rsquo;s clothes to get pockets (Tennis industry dementia), apparently LuluLemon and likely
similar clothing lines are happy to provide 2-4 ball pockets in their pants and skirts.  So go buy them and tell your
local tennis shop that &ldquo;I went elsewhere because tennis clothes are &lsquo;obsolete&rsquo;&rdquo;.  That might get the manufacturers attention!</p>

<h3>My Outfit</h3>

<p>I was going to post my outfit today, but I think I will save that for a blog
&ldquo;What does the Fox wear?  The Supersonic Fox wear?&rdquo; ;&ndash;)</p>

<time datetime="2014-08-25T20:40:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 25<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have been playing with your <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a> for quite some time now&hellip; but
have you thought at all about how they feel?  I assume you are playing in some kind of tennisy outfit: shirts and pants, dress,
skirt, maybe sweats, etc.  But all this time your partner has been <em>naked</em> hasn&rsquo;t it?  All this time&hellip;</p>

<p>We need to fix that, for your first partner is not at their best when they are naked.  And for you to get
better, you need all your partners to be at their best.  Even if they are Serena or Federer (which would be awesome!)</p>

<p>Your poor naked wall may look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2509_w1728_q5.jpg"/></p>

<p>That is not nice!  At least make sure it has basic attire:</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2510_w1622_q5.jpg"/></p>

<p>And if you want to really doll it up, get some tagger to help you do this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2509_w1728_q5_v2.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Targeting</h2>

<p>Just like you had targeting rackets for your serve, you need targets on the court for the rest of your shots.
We will discuss on-court targeting later, but with the wall, you need reference points and goal targets.  The squares
can serve as both.</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2509_w1728_q5_v3.jpg"/></p>

<p>The standard way is like the simple red square: use a bit of masking/painters tape to make a square.  It can be big (the red square is a bit big)
or even just a &lsquo;visible dot&rsquo;.  You can have concentric squares, circles, triangles, or whatever shape you love the most.  But
don&rsquo;t hit against a bare wall if you can avoid it.  Get some kind of reference point up there and put up some kind of goal/s.</p>

<p>Now get them targets!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A donut is when you have won no games.  You have a zero vs. the opponent&rsquo;s who-knows-what.  In normal set play,
your zero is going against their goal of winning six games.  Being 0-5 on your serve is not a lot of fun,
unless you think it is!  And then the only right attitude is: crush or eat that donut!</p>

<p>Today I was playing with a good player, and after a good first set, given work-timing constraints,
we decide to play a &lsquo;bonus&rsquo; four games.
Two for his serves, two for mine.</p>

<p>He went first and I was fiddling/practicing my serve and failed to fiddle well enough the first pass through.
So as of my last service, it was 0 serving 3.  Giant DONUT!  I don&rsquo;t like having donuts, but I don&rsquo;t care about
them today against my able opponent.  I care about them at Wimbledon &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; when they will be against Federer or Nadal.
Seriously!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the late summer and fall of my transformation, I encountered a couple problems.</p>

<ol>
<li> I couldn&rsquo;t really practice &ldquo;real volleys&rdquo;</li>
<li> I couldn&rsquo;t regularly practice &ldquo;real groundstrokes&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<h2>Real Volleys</h2>

<p>The problem with &lsquo;Real Volleys&rsquo; is that good volleys are meant to end a point.  Being at net puts you in great control and
great peril at the same time.  If you have control, you must use it.  To win!  Practicing with a friendly human partner,
it is somewhat &lsquo;not nice&rsquo; to end the point every time they hit a ball to you.  It makes you feel guilty, and until you
can hold almost a dozen balls (more about that soon), it makes practice sessions very much about picking up balls.  If you
are playing with a human partner, I recommend you &lsquo;win&rsquo; on the third ball.  Two back to them, and after that you do whatever
it takes to win.  And they do the same.</p>

<p>Trying to do &lsquo;Real Volleys&rsquo; against a wall is not realistic either.  Too predictable.  Hard to tell what shot you actually made.</p>

<p>The ideal partner for &lsquo;Real Volleys&rsquo; is a Lobster!  Or a similar high-end, random-capable, ball machine.  Don&rsquo;t buy a ball machine
if you are 4.x+ that isn&rsquo;t random-capable.  You will outgrow it almost instantly.  Good for kids and beginners, but not for you.
If you outgrow your first partner (the wall), you need a partner with some modest level of braininess.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing with the targeting rackets, we had this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_9222_h1224.jpg"/></p>

<p>Which is meant to make you look at the court a bit differently.  More like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_9222_h1224_mlf1a1.png"/></p>

<p>Whether you are very consciously aware of it or not, if you repeatedly focus on that racket (the square) and serve,
eventually your mind and body will understand all three green lines <em>and</em> the height of the net.
You will know the shape of the target, how to reach it.  Nice little diddies of &lsquo;Over the net and into the corner&rsquo;
will play deep inside your head.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t use this technique, you will likely have &lsquo;randomness&rsquo; issues.  Not random as in ball-tosses being a bit
unpredictable.  But randomness as in you being unable to land things reliably inside that box.  No amazing curves over
the net, or straight down the middle.  You won&rsquo;t know where you are and where your target is.</p>

<h3>The racket is a lie</h3>

<p>If you study the picture a bit more closely, you will realize the racket is irrelevant.  The actual target for me
is that pole <em>behind</em> the racket.  Between baseboard and windscreen.  The racket wasn&rsquo;t there when I served the
other day, I put it there to explain the idea.  The racket is a very temporary crutch.  Use it until you don&rsquo;t
need it, because you have a pole (very convenient) or some less convenient way to target the same location.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that you have <em>many</em> <a href="/blog/second-partner">second partners</a>, it is time to introduce
your third partner.  Unfortunately your third partner is as socially inept as your first, but
it is much better at one thing: giving you feedback on your serve.</p>

<p>Some people do serve to their <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a>, but the information you get
back is not very useful.  And the wall is missing a number of critical things that I and John (my coach)
think you should be learning.  The only advantage that the wall provides vs. your third partner is
balls come back to you, so you don&rsquo;t need very many balls at all.  Later I will solve
that problem for you and enable you to carry almost a dozen balls!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Again, what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo; is someone who plays tennis with other people.  Your <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a> is very reliable but
not very communicative or varied.  Given a particular shot from you, they always do the same thing.
So we should augment your first partner so you have a bit more diversity and a bit more social interaction.  But you also want
reliability.  So who should your second partner be?</p>

<p>Ideally, you are in a nice tennis community.  Very social.  Very inclusive.  Not terribly serious.  Lots of tennis being played everyday.  If you
are, your second partner will be a bit better than if you are in a less active or less inclusive community.  If you are in the Palo Alto area, simply go to <a href="http://tennispaloalto.com/">http://tennispaloalto.com/</a> to see what social and inclusive meetups are
occurring near you.  If you are somewhere else, try to find out that information from your local tennis shop, library, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have two trainers now.  One is my &ldquo;Tennis Coach&rdquo; (John), and one is my &ldquo;Physical Trainer&rdquo; (Steve).  They
are both awesome and focus on different things for me.  John is getting me to play better by mostly focusing on technique,
and Steve is helping me play better and not injure myself by mostly focusing on my muscles and conditioning.  Steve is
relatively new to me, but we have had one evaluation session, and one real session.  So by this point, I can guess where
things are going :&ndash;)</p>

<p>An important thing about trainers, coaches, and mentors, is you have to <em>trust them</em> and <em>do exactly as they say</em>.  You need
to leave your ego at the door.  You are not the coach.  You are not the trainer.  You do not know what to do, or if you are
so sure of yourself, just walk back out of that door.  And stop wasting your money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About nine or ten months into my transformation, I was hitting serves and ground-strokes at about 90 MPH.  &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
Yes, really.  You can ask my partners, but more objectively you can ask my Go Pro Hero.  The Go Pro is a
wide angle, 120 FPS, video camera.  It has other abilities too, but for tennis, this particular mode will
be the most important for you.  If you don&rsquo;t have a Go Pro Hero, try to borrow one from someone, or stop
by my courts and I will tape you.</p>

<p>Again, about ten months in, I had video confirming the 90 MPH speeds.  Of course, if I am serving at 90 MPH the
obvious question is &ldquo;How do I serve at 120 MPH?&rdquo;  At least, that is the obvious question to me :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Previously I said I could provide nothing to help you determine &ldquo;What should I actually be practicing?&rdquo;  That
was a lie, but it was important to get out of the way: <em>you</em> are responsible for what you should be practicing.
Coaches, friends, random strangers, and so on can suggest things you should be practicing.  They may be right
or wrong (I have had a lot of unsolicited suggestions in the last year, some of which were actually useful),
but you must practice, so it is up to you to decide &lsquo;what&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t have a lot of insight into &lsquo;what&rsquo; you should be practicing, but based on the last year, I do
have one piece of advice: Pick a Model.</p>

<p>Pick some pro in the top 500 of men or women who you want to be like.  Then imagine you play like them.  Start
studying their playing style, look at slow motion of their strokes, imagine that your muscles worked like theirs.
And practice <em>that</em>.  Twelve hours a week (or more&hellip; or less).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So now that you have said &ldquo;hello&rdquo; a few times to your first partner (if not, please go back one blog),
you might be wondering &ldquo;What should I actually be practicing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this blog will not give you specifics on that.  You need to be practicing lots of things.  And
if your partner is a wall, you need to understand how to practice against a wall.  So google these things and
read what USPTA coaches write on the web, or get a USPTA coach to train you on improving your strokes, or go
to a few tennis clinics and see what they say you should work on.  Or if you play at Mitchell and let me watch
you, I (not a USPTA coach) might make suggestions.  Or I will grab my coach (John Chan) to look at you.
But I believe there is nothing I can write on this blog
that will help you with the &lsquo;what&rsquo;.  Sorry.</p>

<p>But if you know the &lsquo;what&rsquo;, I will help you with the &lsquo;how&rsquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I commonly refer to everyone with whom I play tennis as my &lsquo;partner&rsquo;.  I have no opponents, just partners who are either
on the same side of the net, or partners on the opposite of the net.  This may be because we switch up
the matches quite a bit, or because I appreciate their help when we warm up, or just because I am a friendly guy
who does not really want any opponents.  Whatever the reason, that is what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo;: someone who plays tennis
with other people.</p>

<p>If you want to get good at tennis, you need to find a good partner.  And however good you are, your first partner
needs to match your abilities as they are today, and how good they will be in a couple months of serious practice (yes, I
said &lsquo;serious practice&rsquo;&hellip; you are serious aren&rsquo;t you?).</p>

<p>That is a tall order for this first partner to fill.  But amazingly, your first partner will be even better than just
this tall order.  Your first partner will be amazingly reliable and incredibly consistent.  If you don&rsquo;t play tennis
today, it was because <em>you</em> chose not to play and get better.  Seven days a week, your partner will be ready.  You might
have to drive a bit to meet up, but that drive or walk is to tennis courts, and given you are a tennis player that
is expected of you.  And you may have to meet up early in the day or your first partner could be busy.</p>
