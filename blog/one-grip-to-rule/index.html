<div class="entry-content"><p>I hear a lot of &lsquo;chatter&rsquo; about grips when on the court.  People switching between a and b, c and d, forehand and
 backhand.  Never for any particularly logical reason, but just switching all the same.</p>

<p>I play with a classic (1980s) set of grips: Eastern forehand, Eastern backhand, Continental volley, Less-than-Eastern-Backhand
Forehand slice / serve, and finally Eastern-Forehand backhand slice.  Of these, only the last would be a little
unusual / extreme.  I started with a Continental, but my 4500 RPM backhand is partially possible because I am a bit
more extreme than a Continental.  All of these I may slightly tweak to suit my strokes or the specifics of a particular shot.
But they are clearly my core.  I can also do both right and left-handed two-handed backhands, but that is a different story.</p>

<p>A couple days ago I was working on an aggressive topspin lob on my one-handed backhand.  This is among the hardest strokes
 in the game to me.  I can &lsquo;bullet&rsquo; my backhand trivially.  And can topspin the bullet quite easily too.  But getting a
 ball high up in the air with a lot of spin&hellip; that was not happening for me.</p>

<p>At first I cheated and switched to a two-handed backhand.  Actually, ultimately, this cheat may simply be my solution,
but after cheating a bit, I wanted to figure out what was failing with my one handed backhand.</p>

<h2>Forehand topspin</h2>

<p>My forehand was fine, so I switched back to it and thought about what I was doing.  To control any shot, you must be able
to apply full power and go <em>short</em> and <em>long</em>.  Then all you do is dial in the middle.  On my forehand, I couldn&rsquo;t go
really short, but I could lob and hit the service line, which is about as short as you ever want to go with a real shot.
And I could lob into the other court, which is normally a bit longer than you ever want to go.</p>

<p>OK, so this was better than my backhand.  But wasn&rsquo;t as controlled as I wanted.  Why couldn&rsquo;t I go shorter?  Say lob
and have it land <em>on</em> the net.  I pondered and decided it must be the grip.  So I shifted to a western-ish grip.  And
hit some balls.  Really short.  Like straight at my service line.</p>

<p>I pondered Rafa who has the most extreme topspin I am aware of, and I tried to &ldquo;channel him&rdquo; along with &ldquo;his grip&rdquo;.
Now I had something.  Lots of spin.  Not much power, but definitely a lot of spin.</p>

<p>So what was the advantage compared to the backhand?  The grip?  Actually, no.  The eastern backhand is <em>as extreme</em>
as the western forehand for generating topspin.  I will get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Basically the advantage came down to the <em>stance</em> and <em>ball contact</em> point.  For my normal, driven, forehand, I hit the ball
and my racket goes forward and up, eventually with my thumb passing over my left ear.  For my &lsquo;Rafa&rsquo; forehand, I hit
the ball and my racket goes almost straight up, with my thumb never even passing my <em>right</em> ear.  For both of these, I
use an open stance.  The first doesn&rsquo;t require it, but the second totally does (or so I believe).</p>

<p>My flaw with my backhand is I was trying to do an upward drive with a closed stance.  And basically up isn&rsquo;t really possible
because your should is already in front based on the stance vs. on the side.</p>

<p>So my ultimate fix to my backhand lob was to open my stance.  Or to two-hand it.  The later still is better to date.</p>

<h2>One grip, Two grip</h2>

<p>A tennis racket grip is an octagon (usually), so grips are primarily based on hand anatomy compared to that octagon.
But one grip is easy to describe in more normal vernacular: the continental.  The continental is also called the &lsquo;shake hand&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;hatchet&rsquo; grip.  If you place your tennis racket on a table so it is &lsquo;slicing&rsquo; the table, the continental is simply shaking
hands with the grip.  Your &lsquo;v&rsquo; will be on top, your fore-finger hand-joint will be to the side, and your thumb and finger tips
will touch-ish on the other side.</p>

<p>If you had to pick <em>one grip</em> to use throughout an entire game, this seems like the obvious one to choose.  Everything
is symmetric, so both forehand and backhand can be hit.  Flat is easy.  Slice is easy.  Topspin is a little hard, but
is possible.</p>

<p>One grip&hellip; to rule them all.</p>

<p>Except it isn&rsquo;t the <em>right grip</em> to rule anyone nowadays.  Probably wasn&rsquo;t even right back in the sixties.  But lets not
dwell.</p>

<h3>The true one grip</h3>

<p>I mentioned my grips above, but swapping in Rafa for some of mine, we get:</p>

<ul>
<li> Western-ish forehand, topspin</li>
<li> Eastern backhand, topspin</li>
<li> Eastern-ish backhand, forehand slice</li>
<li> Western-ish backhand, backhand slice</li>
<li> Eastern-ish backhand, serve</li>
</ul>


<p>Isn&rsquo;t the symmetry above a little suspicious?  Now consider that a Western Forehand and an Eastern Backhand <em>are identical</em> grips (just flipped in motion direction)
and we now have:</p>

<ul>
<li> EB-ish forehand, topspin</li>
<li> EB backhand, topspin</li>
<li> EB-ish forehand, slice</li>
<li> EB-ish backhand, slice</li>
<li> EB-ish backhand, serve</li>
</ul>


<p>So the true one grip is the EB/WF grip.  It is the most extreme spin grip.  It is just kind of hard to &lsquo;wield&rsquo; so people
tend to approach it vs. use it.</p>

<p>And why it is both aweful and awesome is simple to see when you describe how to grip it in normal vernacular.</p>

<p>Put your racket <em>flat</em> on a table.  Now shake hands with it.  Now you have a flyswatter vs. a hatchet.  Awesome!</p>

<p>This hold makes it so your default capability with any ball coming toward you (or simply dropped in the air) is to <em>slice it</em>.
On either side of your body (forehand, backhand).  In either direction (forward, backward).  And even on either side of the racket (bottom strings, top strings).</p>

<p>Slice it eight ways baby :&ndash;)</p>
