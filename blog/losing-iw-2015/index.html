<div class="entry-content"><p>I landed in Indian Wells after a ten hour commute on Friday, February 27th.  I was expecting to spend the weekend
getting used to the courts and finding people to play with.  Unfortunately, the weekend didn&rsquo;t work out that way,
and this helped contribute to a very rapid demise on my part on Monday.  To continue to perfect my &lsquo;draw&rsquo;, I believe
Chase (the #1 seed, 150-ish in the world) asked to have two matches on the same day&hellip; or maybe someone else in our
subtree did.  Either way, instead of two days to go long (beat #150) or go home, this was all set up for Monday morning
and afternoon.</p>

<p>Arriving on Friday (night) helped me get very comfortable in Indian Wells by the end of the weekend.  I met the people running the tournament on
Saturday, tested out the courts twice (morning and afternoon), found a good local tennis shop, and found food and coffee
to nourish me.  There were two problems though:</p>

<ul>
<li> No other challenger showed up on Saturday to the courts, so I had &lsquo;no one&rsquo; to play with.  I offered to play with a club player, but he apparently got scared of &ldquo;my level&rdquo;</li>
<li> It started raining on Sunday.  I sacrificed some of my Wimbledon balls to the rain on other courts (IW is very protective of their courts), so I got two workouts on Sunday.  <em>But</em> I could not use the ATP balls I bought on Saturday.</li>
</ul>


<p>So when the courts dried just-in-time for my 9AM match on Monday</p>

<ul>
<li> I had never played with the ATP balls</li>
<li> On the IW courts</li>
<li> With a serious player</li>
</ul>


<p>Chase was annoyed by this as well, as he apparently also thought it was a good idea to &lsquo;warm up&rsquo; for a couple hours and
acclimate to the courts you were about to play matches on.  I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed but next time I would be much more concerned.</p>

<h2>ATP Men&rsquo;s Tennis Balls</h2>

<p>As soon as I started warming up with my partner (opponent), I was shocked.  My strokes were missing the court.
I don&rsquo;t mean missing the line&hellip; the ball was coming off my racket with so much energy, I was hitting the fence!
Apparently ATP Men&rsquo;s Balls (women play with more normal balls) are significantly more bouncy/efficient than any
tennis ball I had ever seen before.  So if I was trying for sixty feet, the ball was going seventy.  That is a lot of change.
My opponent was a local (lived there and had warmed up others in the Paribas challenge the year before) and this was &lsquo;normal&rsquo; for him.  He
wasn&rsquo;t particularly amazing (really just one serve&hellip; not super fast or nasty&hellip; decent ground strokes&hellip; no real net
game) but he was definitely comfortable.  I was incredibly uncomfortable.  Not unhappy or angry or anything, but very
surprised.  And unable to adapt.</p>

<p>My normal approach to adapting to a too-hot game are pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li> Swap in slower and spinnier equipment</li>
<li> Try to &ldquo;Go Rafa&rdquo; and spin the ball more, reducing the pace a little</li>
</ul>


<p>The first just couldn&rsquo;t do the trick at all.  It is meant to deal with a couple-feet-long issue, not ten foot long.
And it turns out the first and the second combined approach &ldquo;produce more spin&rdquo; actually doesn&rsquo;t work either with these ATP
balls.  I will describe the issue in another article in depth, but the quick summary is that given the ball efficiency,
more spin was causing more speed at the same time.  Yes, if I hit a lot slower I could do it.  But that is simply death
at this level of play.  I needed to hit at different angles (especially for my serve), and I do not normally adjust
that.  And so I never thought to adjust it at IW.  Must have faulted 75% of the time, where I rarely fault more than
20% of the time normally.</p>

<p>I controlled almost every ball in the match.  And managed to make unforced errors on pretty much all of them.  Well,
actually, I was getting better in the second set, but I was simply &ldquo;too stupid&rdquo; and &ldquo;too slow&rdquo; to adjust in time.</p>

<h2>Preparing for IW 2016 and other tournaments</h2>

<p>So IW was an incredibly efficient learning environment.  I did watch Chase play next to me, so I have some feel for a &lsquo;150&rsquo; player,
and I learned about things that could vary (balls) more than I ever expected, and I learned I need more control points
to adjust within my game.</p>

<p>I brought back the ATP balls I bought on Saturday and have been on the court three times in the last 36 hours with them, and
now I adjust my service angle (how far forward the toss), target the service line on ground strokes more, and am
working on a dozen
other things that may help me with IW 2016 and other professional matches.</p>

<p>Oh, And I plan to study the weather more carefully before I head to a venue :&ndash;)</p>
