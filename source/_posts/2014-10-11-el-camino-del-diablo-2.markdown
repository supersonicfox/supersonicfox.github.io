Continuing the road to the devil...

## Serve 'C'

Again, the serves are alphabetical on the time that John or I came up with them.  After understanding the ballistic serve 'B',
we returned to a more normal top-spin serve 'C'.  This turns out to be both one of the most useful serves if you want to 'win'
or just 'have fun' (without blowing people's minds like 'B' does).

Serve 'C' is also amongst the most complex of the serves until we get into the hell range.

To serve an 'A', your racket comes
up from behind, hits the ball in front of you (quadrant 'I' if you look down on your body <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry)>)
and then finishes into quadrant 'III'.  So for a right-handed person the racket ends to the left of your left leg.  At
least to me, this all seems very natural and I can do a butterfly movement all day long where the racket goes up and over into 'III'
and then comes back up to the start in 'I' to do it all again.

If you move the ball more to the left and on top of you, and swing an 'A' you might think you get a 'C', but that is not a 'C',
it is just a kind of weird 'A'.  'C' is really about understanding your rotator cuff <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff>, which is an impressive and potentially fragile
set of muscles that connect your arm to your body.  If you google 'rotator cuff', the first entries are about injuries!  So
please talk with a coach before _trying_ anything I am describing.  I am not a doctor!  Don't _trust me with your body_

So how is 'C' related to the rotator cuff?  I will show you!

With a racket in hand, stick whichever arm you serve with straight out from your body.  Like the lower arms of this: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci#mediaviewer/File:Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg>.
Now have the racket face upward (your palm forward depending on grip).  The face of the racket should be forward, toward the net.
Now rotate just your shoulder so the racket is downward and the face of the racket is now to facing the fence.  About 180 degrees of rotation.
Do that a few times to get the feel of it.  You can enlarge it a bit to get more than 180 degrees too, but that core 180 degrees
is the core of how 'C' is very different from 'A'.

After practicing sideway, practice the same move with your arm vertical.  The racket starts facing the net over your head, and ends facing the fence and away
from your body.  John calls this a 'helicopter'.  Some other people call it 'wiping a wet diaper'.  This helicopter move
imparts a lot of racket velocity: I can actually serve quite nicely using it alone (back to being 'to the side').  And
that extra velocity is very effective for producing spin.  Eventually Tennis becomes all-about-the-spin: velocities are
so high that _going faster_ will simply _go outer_.  But _spinning faster_ will stay in and drive people crazy.

### Wrong-side

OK, so you take an 'A', add the helicopter, and toss the ball slightly more left and on top of you, and you get a 'C'.  That is
most of the basics of a 'C' except for one major issue... where does the racket _go_ after you hit that ball?  With an 'A' the racket
went forward and veering to the 'III' quadrant (left of left-leg for a right hander) is natural.  With a 'C' you just flipped
your racket way to the right and quadrant 'III' is no where close.

Well, if 'III' is gone, the only thing left is 'IV', so that is where you have to finish.  Except 'IV' is where your other leg is!
Don't wack it!  It isn't pleasant!

You need to get that leg out of the way to do a real 'C', and because of rotational aspects and other dynamics, the best place to put
it is further away (up) in 'IV'.  So the racket goes below your outstretched leg, which gives it enough time to slow down.

### What?

So 'C' is really quite complex and I probably can't explain it well without photos (maybe later), but I wanted to get
something down on paper to start with.  If you practice the helicopter to your side and above, you will begin to
understand the 'C'.  That is a good start.  Just keep your shoulder attached while you do it :-)




So as of about March, 2014, I had one serve:

   * A: Full Power Serve.  Hit relatively flatly, arm finishes to my left, and I am right handed.

Serve 'A' seems straightforward, and it is.  But serving is anything but straightforward.  Learning to springboard, learning
to handle any kind of toss, and even learning to toss a fuzzy yellow ball... all of these things seem simple but they aren't.
So 'A' lets you worry about things other than "How do I hit thee?  Let me count the ways!".

For quite a while, I refused to learn a different serve because I didn't really get 'A', so didn't want to be distracted by
something different.

But one fine Friday, I said the fateful words, "John, I am ready to learn another serve".  That was the birth of 'B'...

## Serve 'B'

My serves are simply 'in-order' alphabetically, but sometimes coincidences occur.  Serve 'B' is also my 'Ballistic' serve.
It is an insane serve from John, and witnessed by me when I said "I am ready".  To serve 'B' you have to let the fuzzy
yellow ball fall _behind_ you.  And by behind you, I mean _way behind you_.  You are still headed forward but that ball is going
backward.

And you are patient right?  You must be patient!  For eventually that ball will be behind you enough to hit 'B'.  'B' is hit up
into the air and it lands in the service box (if you are so lucky) and bounces.... and is never to be seen again.  At its best
'B' leaves the court after that bounce.  One bounce... one kill.

The crazy thing about great shots is they commonly don't work how you think they do.  To hit a 'B' you don't hit "up" at all.  'B'
is among the crazy slice family.  You put incredibly amount of spin on a ball, and because of its position, that spin does
incredibly things to a ball.  As I mentioned, _you_ are going forward.  Ignoring the movement of your racket, as long
as you are going forward, you will impart forward kinetic energy to the ball.  Effectively _your body language_ hit the
ball into the service box.  Now your racket is free!

A freed racket is a marvelous thing, and 'B' takes that freedom to solely produce 'kick'.  The ball lands... it 'kicks'...
it is gone!

Returning a 'B' is a different topic, but understanding a 'B' is a gateway to understanding the insanity of 'slice'.  Which
is incredibly awesome!!!
