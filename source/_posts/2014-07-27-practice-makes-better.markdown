So now that you have said "hello" a few times to your first partner (if not, please go back one blog),
you might be wondering "What should I actually be practicing?"

Unfortunately, this blog will not give you specifics on that.  You need to be practicing lots of things.  And
if your partner is a wall, you need to understand how to practice against a wall.  So google these things and
read what USPTA coaches write on the web, or get a USPTA coach to train you on improving your strokes, or go
to a few tennis clinics and see what they say you should work on.  Or if you play at Mitchell and let me watch
you, I (not a USPTA coach) might make suggestions.  Or I will grab my coach (John Chan) to look at you.
But I believe there is nothing I can write on this blog
that will help you with the 'what'.  Sorry.

But if you know the 'what', I will help you with the 'how'.

<!-- more -->

###How

For the moment, I will assume you are playing with your first partner (i.e. a wall), but if not, the 'how' only
changes a bit.  If you are playing against a ball machine, the 'how' changes in ways that help you (because ball machines
are amazing and they don't expect you to return the ball to them).  If you are playing against a human partner (who is not
a ball-feeding-coach), the 'how' is a little more complex because people generally like the ball to go back to them.
But for the moment, I will ignore these nuances and start with your first wall-ish partner.

#### Incrementally

First rule of 'how': incrementally.  You are working up to a better you!  Or at least a better tennis-playing you!  I transformed
in a year.  But that was just 'what it took', not what I expected.  And you shouldn't use it as a reference.  You need no
reference: this is a journey.  Maybe lifelong.  I am still working on mine, where next I will go (hah!) to Wimbledon.  I think
big, but I am still working incrementally.  I might be 90 before I get to Wimbledon. :-)

So don't expect any incredible improvements off the bat.  Try to improve, but all improvements are doing things _better_ than
you do today.  Or if you start something completely different, take it slow.  Assume it will take you 20+ hours to 'get it' at
all.  This will not harm you in making progress, and will make sure you don't get frustrated or _injured_.


The incrementally applies to both day-to-day, but also within-session.  Any given day, you need to start slow.  If you think
you are so innately good that you can avoid warming up slowly... then come play against me.  I may be a 5.0 and as I progressed
up that ladder, I got _slower_ and _slower_.  I am 48, so maybe it is related to my age.  But I believe the _slower_ is mostly related to
how much my body is doing... how many _tiny_ muscles are working along side _huge_ muscles to produce a 100+ MPH ball.

I was actually very foolish early on, and just barely squeaked by without injuring myself.  Once I took two weeks off because I
pulled a muscle in my back that I had _no idea_ I even had.  It was partially bad form, but it was mostly me pushing to get a 90 MPH
serve a bit too quickly.

So this is a journey you are on every session and every day.  Every session is a journey where you warm up incrementally: slow
 easy strokes to start.  My coach likes beginners to hit ground-strokes to each other within the service box: I think
   it helps you remember or learn how to put top-spin on the ball.  So maybe do the same,
 either with a person or a wall.  And then move further back and do a fuller stroke but no heavy effort or grunting (I make a
 lot of 'air noise' on the court).  And then start picking up the pace.

A final aspect of incremental is that you should _review_ and _improve_ before you learn _new_.  Make sure your main serve is
working before working on a new serve.  It isn't that your new serve is less important, but your body _knows_ the existing
serve, so make sure it remembers it.

#### Consistently

I believe you need to be at least minimally consistent to your practice.  Don't take weeks off and make up for them later.
Yes, you can go on a vacation for a week, but ideally even then you maintain a minimal level of activity in the sport.
I can't be sure this is truly required (vs. the Incrementally, which I am willing to bet on), and feel free to follow someone
else's advice over mine.  But I have a couple explanations for the consistency that may convince you (or give you a good
arguing point about).

First, if you are consistent about the workout you can be inconsistent (also known as varied) about its content.  About four
months into my transformation, I was now playing against a ball machine vs. a wall to workout.  By consistently having three+
sessions a week, I could make one session have a major focus on returning serves.  Returning serves is a lot of fun for me
(and terrorizes some of my opponents now), but setting up to return serves with a ball machine requires a couple tables, a
ladder, and a fair amount of strength and effort.  That is, it has a high overhead and costs me a bunch of time.  But the
consistency of 3 weekly sessions made me sure I could cover other things with the other two session.

Second, you are trying to convince _your body_ and _your mind_ that Tennis is important to them.
Your body should expect to have to play tennis
several times a week, and it can't slack off and expect you would do the same ("I'm too tired").  And if you spend
a late night drinking, your mind can't tell you in the morning to slack off either ("I'm to 'tired'").  No, when
the buzzer goes off, your body and your mind _are going to that court_.  And after a few weeks of that they both
start towing the line, and the rest of your habits fall into place to match.

#### As much as ****ing possible

The final advice is to figure out how to get to 12+ hours of tennis a week.  Yes, TWELVE HOURS.  You don't have TWELVE HOURS?
Are you _sure_?  What do you do between 5AM and 7AM everyday?  How many days of the week have a time period between 5AM and 7AM?
If you care about getting better at tennis... I just found you your TWELVE HOURS, and I will let you do something else with the
spare two hours.

Why twelve?  Because by the time your body and mind hit twelve hours a week, they both realize that tennis is not just important...
for some reason it is now _essential to your survival_.  And if they were towing the line to be consistent, they are now standing
at attention and even _thinking for you_ to figure out how to survive this incredibly important tennis-thing.

If you really can't do 12, pick a lesser number _that you can't do_ and then figure out how to do that.  Practice as much as
possible.  No less than 3x the number of lessons you have a week (e.g. 3 hours per 1 hour lesson, and those 3 hours are _practice_,
not social matches).  With that multiplier you coach will be very happy with you.  My coach (John Chan) get's a 10x multiplier
from me, and we happily train me in 2-3 new good habits every week (crazy slice serve among them this last week).

### Summary of How

Incrementally, consistently, and as much as possible (12+ hours ideally), with your first partner
or anyone willing to hit with you
