  <div class="entry-content"><p>I commonly refer to everyone with whom I play tennis as my &lsquo;partner&rsquo;.  I have no opponents, just partners who are either
on the same side of the net, or partners on the opposite of the net.  This may be because we switch up
the matches quite a bit, or because I appreciate their help when we warm up, or just because I am a friendly guy
who does not really want any opponents.  Whatever the reason, that is what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo;: someone who plays tennis
with other people.</p>

<p>If you want to get good at tennis, you need to find a good partner.  And however good you are, your first partner
needs to match your abilities as they are today, and how good they will be in a couple months of serious practice (yes, I
said &lsquo;serious practice&rsquo;&hellip; you are serious aren&rsquo;t you?).</p>

<p>That is a tall order for this first partner to fill.  But amazingly, your first partner will be even better than just
this tall order.  Your first partner will be amazingly reliable and incredibly consistent.  If you don&rsquo;t play tennis
today, it was because <em>you</em> chose not to play and get better.  Seven days a week, your partner will be ready.  You might
have to drive a bit to meet up, but that drive or walk is to tennis courts, and given you are a tennis player that
is expected of you.  And you may have to meet up early in the day or your first partner could be busy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that my daughter and I had equipment, we needed just a couple more things.  Courts and Time.</p>

<p>We live within walking distance of Mitchell Park in Palo Alto.  Mitchell has amazing tennis courts!  They clean themselves
every day magically.  They are right next to backboards so people can warm up and then join games.  There are a fair number
of them (seven) and within an easy walk there are six more.  And the tennis players at Mitchell are amongst the friendliest
you will ever encounter.  I am happy to now be counted among this elite community and to be expanding its reach every week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To play tennis, you  need equipment.  I grew up with tennis in the 1970s and 1980s.  By the time I was &ldquo;serious&rdquo; about tennis,
I played with Head Professional aluminum rackets.  I loved them: indestructible unless you were ridiculously mad at the court.  Until
2013, &ldquo;Red Heads&rdquo; were my only kind of racket:  Tiny, stiff, and indestructible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been writing a book <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a> and playing a lot of tennis.  The tennis was a major part of
how I transformed in the last year, and may have been a major enabler for writing the book.  Losing 40 pounds of fat, gaining 10+ of muscle,
and having an insanely fun &amp; social activity may have been major catalysts for my transformation.  The book will cover some of what
happened with tennis, but it has a lot of topics in it, and it is mostly about learning &amp; kindness repeatedly being applied after
repeated failures.  This site and blog will focus just on tennis, hoping to help others be better players, and told from
a somewhat elderly, not super-fit (at the start), but definitely committed player.  Not a professional tennis player, but a professional <em>learner</em> who
applied those skills to tennis.</p>

<p>I hope it helps someone else have a little better (or a lot better) of a game, while still having an insanely fun time playing.</p>
