<div class="entry-content"><p>A simple organization around doing any physical activity is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Form: The maneuvers of your body, muscles, joints, etc. that you use to cary out the activity</li>
<li>Fitness: How strong and fit you are at doing the above form</li>
<li>Timing: How you do things at the right time to be successful (or better) at the activity</li>
<li>Mentality: What you think when doing the activity (beyond Form and Timing)</li>
</ul>


<p>This post is specifically on the third of the above: &lsquo;Timing&rsquo;.  How do you get the right timing for the various
strokes and activities you have in tennis?</p>

<p>In music, being aware of timing is basically innate to both you and the activity.
You can use a metronome to produce a consistent &lsquo;beat&rsquo;, and you can easily
hear the different speeds.  Percussion instruments (which include the Piano), are
the most obvious of all the musical instruments.  And this obviousness almost
certainly makes timing easier (on the one hand) and more awesome (consider a drumline or a great pianist)
on the other hand.  Tennis players do not have the awesome timing of a great drummer.
Or do they?  And if they do, how did they get it?</p>

<h2>Grunt! or Ha!</h2>

<p>The answer to awesome depends on what you think of service returns and rapid volleying.  I will
tend to stay with service returns as I consider them to be the most visibly awesome aspect in
tennis, and I believe I can produce visuals to help describe &lsquo;what is going on&rsquo;.</p>

<p>To start at the beginning, I will start with the simplest of timing.  When do you hit the ball?  How do you know?
There are two good answers:</p>

<ul>
<li> I know because I just saw me hit the ball – I was watching it</li>
<li> I know because I heard the ball hit the racket – I was listening to it</li>
</ul>


<p>Of these, the first is a little more reliable: light travels faster, and background noise does not impede it.  Strangely though,
the route to great timing is more likely based on the latter: our brains are very sound-timing oriented compared to
our vision.  If sound entered your ear/s only 30 times per second, you would be <em>very disturbed</em>.
Your brain doesn&rsquo;t like that.  Your brain works with sound <em>much faster</em> than 30 times per second, and it is
very good at telling the distance between those sounds (that distance-between-sound is basically the definition of &lsquo;pitch&rsquo;).</p>

<p>So although it is import to watch the ball, and your brain does work with the information, ideally you would always
have both &lsquo;I can see it&rsquo; and &lsquo;I can hear it&rsquo;.  If the ball made no sound when it hits your racket, simply make the
 sound for it.  In my case I &lsquo;grunt&rsquo; when I hit a ball at my fullest.  But when I am playing softer, I say/think something
 like &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually think &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; because I have a different word, but John recommends &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; and so I do too.  John is a better
coach than me :&ndash;)</p>

<h2>A! Ah!</h2>

<p>OK, so you watch the ball as you hit it with your racket, and you made a &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; at the moment of contact.  That is kind of the
start to awesome timing, but not really.  There is no &lsquo;time&rsquo; involved, just a moment-in-time.  We need &lsquo;time&rsquo; to get &lsquo;timing&rsquo;.</p>

<p>To get the most basic form of time, you need two moments.  The &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; is the second moment: you hit the ball.  Not much more to do than
that on that current ball (although maybe&hellip;)  So you need the first moment&hellip; the &lsquo;A&rsquo; moment. But let us call it the &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; moment.</p>

<p>So now we have a nice timing pair:</p>

<ul>
<li> Ah!  – ?</li>
<li> Hah! – Contact</li>
</ul>


<p>If the Hah! is Contact, what should the Ah! be? Turns out there are lots of choices&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ah! the bounce</h3>

<p>You can &lsquo;Ah! the bounce&rsquo; before contact.  This is among the most basic (and also the most powerful) &ldquo;Ah! Hah!&rdquo; pairs.
The bounce is basically the last easily determined moment in time before contact.  By getting the feel of the following variations,
you open yourself up to both some interestingly powerful shots (e.g. on the rise off the bounce) and also start
yourself down the path of insane reaction times where the &lsquo;dot&rsquo;s below are ticks at 30 ticks per second or even 120 ticks per second!</p>

<ul>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Hah!&rdquo;</li>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! &hellip;&hellip; Hah!&rdquo;</li>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! &hellip; Hah!&rdquo;</li>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! . Hah!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>If you can get your brain and body to do these variations with a dot representing 1/120th of a second, you can likely return
any professional&rsquo;s serve.</p>

<h3>Ah! the hit</h3>

<p>You can also choose to &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the contact (the &lsquo;hit&rsquo;) of the &ldquo;opponent&rdquo;.  This is way earlier than the bounce, but the big
advantage is that you are now <em>clearly tracking that ball</em>.  You have made sure your brain and eyes are paying attention
and can start moving your body where it needs to move (both feet and hands).</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take this up a level!</p>

<h2>La Ti Da!</h2>

<p>Simply combine the two above with a simple rename</p>

<ul>
<li> La – The Hit</li>
<li> Ti – The Bounce</li>
<li> Da – Contact</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have seen me return serve at my best a few months ago (April 2014), that is what I was doing.  And I could <em>totally crush</em>
many serves that seemed to others to be almost un-returnable.  But bit by bit my &lsquo;ticks&rsquo; became faster and faster and by &lsquo;Ti&rsquo;
I was in position and the &lsquo;Da&rsquo; was sending a decent serve back at the net man (or the space in the center) at a nice 100+ MPH
pace.</p>

<p>Get your &ldquo;Ah! Hah!&#8221;s and your &#8220;La Ti Da!&#8221;s into your head and your game&hellip; and you will become much better very quickly.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t take my word on it.</h2>

<p>Some captures from high-speed video to show the idea.</p>

<h3>Ah! Bounce, Hah! Contact</h3>

<h4>Ah! Bounce</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f3_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Hah! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h3>Ah! Hit, Hah! Contact</h3>

<h4>Ah! Hit</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f2_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Hah! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h3>La! Hit, Ti! Bounce, Da! Contact</h3>

<p>Switching to &ldquo;La Ti Da!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>La! Hit</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f2_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Ti! Bounce</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f3_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Da! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h3>Fa! Toss, La! Hit, Ti! Bounce, Da! Contact</h3>

<p>And to help you beat me <em>now</em>, I use something closer to this as my model.</p>

<h4>Fa! Toss</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f1_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>La! Hit</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f2_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Ti! Bounce</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f3_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Da! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>And the result :&ndash;)</h4>

<p>By the &lsquo;ticks&rsquo; (30 feet in about &frac14;th of a second), this ball is traveling at about 80 MPH to the net,
so above 90 MPH off the racket against a relatively slow serve.  To confirm the fraction of the second,
if you look at the &ldquo;net man&rdquo; (his name is Tuan&hellip; he is <em>very</em> fast), he has barely moved by the time the ball passes the net.
The server has not moved at all between the two frames.</p>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f5_w779.png"/></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The core of the idea is &ldquo;Ah! Hah!&rdquo;.  This enables you to leverage your natural auditory and mental timing capabilities to get
your physical timing right.  Right can be &ldquo;warmed up&rdquo;, &ldquo;match ready&rdquo;, or &ldquo;on a new level&rdquo;.  Try it.  It&rsquo;s insanely great :&ndash;)</p>
