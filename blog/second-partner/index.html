<div class="entry-content"><p>Again, what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo; is someone who plays tennis with other people.  Your <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a> is very reliable but
not very communicative or varied.  Given a particular shot from you, they always do the same thing.
So we should augment your first partner so you have a bit more diversity and a bit more social interaction.  But you also want
reliability.  So who should your second partner be?</p>

<p>Ideally, you are in a nice tennis community.  Very social.  Very inclusive.  Not terribly serious.  Lots of tennis being played everyday.  If you
are, your second partner will be a bit better than if you are in a less active or less inclusive community.  If you are in the Palo Alto area, simply go to <a href="http://tennispaloalto.com/">http://tennispaloalto.com/</a> to see what social and inclusive meetups are
occurring near you.  If you are somewhere else, try to find out that information from your local tennis shop, library, etc.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But onward to the &lsquo;second partner&rsquo;.  Who should your second partner be?  It should be <em>anyone playing</em> at the same time as you
who could possibly hit with you.  I am a 5.0, and if you see me serving at Mitchell (I wear red on top, black on the bottom),
please come by and ask to hit with me.  Whether you are a 1.0 or a 6.0, I will hit with you and I will do my best to make
it fun for you and for me.  Similarly if you are a 6.0 or something less, you should be happy to hit with a 1.0 through 6.0 (or Federer
or Serena if either of them stops by).</p>

<p>Hitting precise shots is not easy!  Hitting at 30MPH within the hit range of a 1.0 is not easy.  Pushing the 1.0 to move a little more,
to handle a bit of speed, to handle a bit of spin, and so on, all without making them frustrated, this is true tennis control.</p>

<p>Surviving 90+ MPH ground-strokes is also not easy.  But any <em>real player</em> who claims to be 4.0+ can hit you 30,40,50,60,70,80,90 MPH
on each and every shot.  Or if they can&rsquo;t, they should be <em>striving</em> to do so.  And making the rally fun for both of you.</p>

<p>So whether it is a person serving who could have a real partner (empty courts aren&rsquo;t very communicative either), someone with their
first partner (a wall), someone who&rsquo;s partner recently wandered away and may have some more energy, or a three-some needing a fourth, &hellip; just go ask &ldquo;would you
like to hit?&rdquo;  At worse they will say no, and you can either ask someone else or go to your first partner who will never say &lsquo;no&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Some people are jerks.  They will say no when they should say yes.  Some people have different goals.  Every couple weeks I ask
&lsquo;David&rsquo; to hit and he always says no.  He apparently uses his first partner to meditate.  It makes me a little sad, but I
understand.  The jerks I don&rsquo;t, but I just let them go.</p>

<p>To be great at tennis you have to be open to improving (even fanatical about it), understanding, and willing to let things go.</p>
