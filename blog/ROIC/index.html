<div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing my &lsquo;insanity&rsquo; subtopic, and venturing even further from Tennis, I am going to help you optimize you life even more.
Insanely great people interact with each other in only four ways:</p>

<ul>
<li> Requests</li>
<li> Offers</li>
<li> Information</li>
<li> Commitments</li>
</ul>


<p>These aren&rsquo;t the only ways people can interact with each other (we are amazingly good at coercing and killing each other),
but if two mages or power players interact with each other, these are the only tools they need as long as life and limb
is not on the line.  These don&rsquo;t just make you a better person (say morally), they make you an incredibly optimized person that is
much more productive because fewer things are &ldquo;in the air&rdquo; in your life.</p>

<h2>Requests</h2>

<p>Requests are simply what they sound like.  I would like a drive to the airport.  I would like you to buy a five million dollar house.
Amazingly, I have made both those requests in my life (the latter more recent&hellip; I can generally get to the airport on my own).
You might think asking someone to put $5MM into a house is a pretty bizarre and misguided thing&hellip; but it was simply a
request.  The person (&ldquo;S&rdquo;) didn&rsquo;t have to do it if he didn&rsquo;t want to, and I gave &ldquo;S&rdquo; enough information to understand
why I made the request even though that is totally optional.  As long as &lsquo;no&rsquo; is fine, it is simply a request.  &ldquo;S&rdquo; ultimately
did not buy the five million dollar house because it did not match his goals at the time.</p>

<h2>Offers</h2>

<p>Offers are again simply what they sound like.  I offer bread to people pretty much every week (the bread is from Manressa, so it
is not ordinary bread).  I have offered my house to people.  Offered my car to a nephew.  Offered to hook people up to this likes of George Lucas.
Offered to sell people my tennis racquets.  Offered to loan people my ball machine.</p>

<p>Strangely offers are commonly not taken.  I can&rsquo;t really explain that.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Again, information is just information.  Things I think, experienced, believe, or maybe even &lsquo;know&rsquo; that you might be interested in.
Information can support the two above or it can be just for the fun of exchanging information.</p>

<h2>Commitments</h2>

<p>Offers are inherently commitments.  They can have a time limit (I will sell you my racquet, but it expires on Friday when I have to
pay for it myself), but barring that, commitments must be fulfilled or this system does not work.  Living up to your commitments
may seem onerous, but as soon as your commit to committing, it is actually a relief.  You <em>must</em> do it.  People can&rsquo;t
dissuade you.  You can&rsquo;t dissuade yourself.  Just do it.  Except if it involves the taking of lives&hellip;. unless you are
really up to that level :&ndash;/</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>I recently offered two tables to a robotics tournament.  I forget if I got an acceptance of the offer, but I brought the two tables
and put them into the building for people to use.  I set up one of the tables myself, and left the other for other uses.
At the end of the day, I retrieved the one I set up, but could not find the other one after many minutes of looking for it.</p>

<p>Instead of being annoyed, I simply did the ROIC part again.  I explained the table situation.  Requested that if they find my marked
table when tearing down the event, that they put it outside the building.  And committed to picking it up later that evening.</p>

<p>I returned at about 8PM, scrounged around, but no table.  So I am down a table and need to buy a new one if I still need two.</p>

<p>Yes, I could email people about the missing table&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t care to waste my time on that.  Yes, I could be annoyed about
losing something of value&hellip; but again I don&rsquo;t care to waste my time on that.  Finally&hellip; Yes, I could have emailed someone <em>before</em>
trying to pick up the table&hellip; but that would cause a stall in the system (my system) and I did not want to waste time/energy on that.</p>

<p>I made Offers, Requests, Commitments, and provided Information.  And as of this blog posting&hellip; I am completely done with the event.</p>

<p>But maybe someone will return my table later in my life.  And then I will thank them.  So it is really ROICT.</p>
