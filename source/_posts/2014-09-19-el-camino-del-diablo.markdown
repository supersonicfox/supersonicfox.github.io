As I have mentioned before, I _do not_ have a second serve.  For nine or more months I worked on a single
serve that was meant to be as close as possible to Federer's flat-ish serve.  That was my model.  I served
it twice.  No second serve, just a first serve served twice.  I failed a lot.  And over time I became pretty
insanely great with that model.  At least insanely great for a 50-year old geezer :-)

After I managed to have a reasonable serve, which I simply named 'A', I was willing to consider other serves.
To really get a strong beach-hold on 'A' I ultimately needed a coach (John) and John was very generous with
offering me "Other Serves".  Again, none of these are a second serve, they are just "different serves".  John
is very scientific and intelligent and pretty much insanely great at teaching people about tennis.  If they
want to listen.  To his insanity.  Which it isn't.

## Serve 'A'

So as of about March, 2014, I had one serve:

   * A: Full Power Serve.  Hit relatively flatly, arm finishes to my left, and I am right handed.

Serve 'A' seems straightforward, and it is.  But serving is anything but straightforward.  Learning to springboard, learning
to handle any kind of toss, and even learning to toss a fuzzy yellow ball... all of these things seem simple but they aren't.
So 'A' lets you worry about things other than "How do I hit thee?  Let me count the ways!".

For quite a while, I refused to learn a different serve because I didn't really get 'A', so didn't want to be distracted by
something different.

But one fine Friday, I said the fateful words, "John, I am ready to learn another serve".  That was the birth of 'B'...

## Serve 'B'

My serves are simply 'in-order' alphabetically, but sometimes coincidences occur.  Serve 'B' is also my 'Ballistic' serve.
It is an insane serve from John, and witnessed by me when I said "I am ready".  To serve 'B' you have to let the fuzzy
yellow ball fall _behind_ you.  And by behind you, I mean _way behind you_.  You are still headed forward but that ball is going
backward.

And you are patient right?  You must be patient!  For eventually that ball will be behind you enough to hit 'B'.  'B' is hit up
into the air and it lands in the service box (if you are so lucky) and bounces.... and is never to be seen again.  At its best
'B' leaves the court after that bounce.  One bounce... one kill.

The crazy thing about great shots is they commonly don't work how you think they do.  To hit a 'B' you don't hit "up" at all.  'B'
is among the crazy slice family.  You put incredibly amount of spin on a ball, and because of its position, that spin does
incredibly things to a ball.  As I mentioned, _you_ are going forward.  Ignoring the movement of your racket, as long
as you are going forward, you will impart forward kinetic energy to the ball.  Effectively _your body language_ hit the
ball into the service box.  Now your racket is free!

A freed racket is a marvelous thing, and 'B' takes that freedom to solely produce 'kick'.  The ball lands... it 'kicks'...
it is gone!

Returning a 'B' is a different topic, but understanding a 'B' is a gateway to understanding the insanity of 'slice'.  Which
is incredibly awesome!!!
