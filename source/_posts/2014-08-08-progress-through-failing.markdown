After I wrote the first version of http://slumsofpaloalto.com/ (the MVB), my aunt sent me a very interesting article.
It was about 'Focus' and two mildly successful people: Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.  You can read it <a href="http://qz.com/231907/why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-are-so-successful-in-one-word/">Here</a>.

Accidentally, this posting will do the same thing with the word 'Progress'.  'Progress' is both <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Progress+definition">a verb and a noun</a>.
And for you to succeed with the noun "Make progress", you must succeed with the verb "Progress".

<!-- more -->

And what are you going to progress through?
Failing of course (see <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">my book</a> for lots more info about success through failing)!
You don't want to avoid failing, you want to fail a lot.  And then progress through it so you can start failing
at something else.  Day after day, fail after fail, onward to Wimbledon.  Seriously.

And you can leverage your incredible advantage over Federer and Nadal: I doubt you make any money from tennis, so winning
shouldn't really be at all important to your livelihood.  And more radically: it shouldn't be at all important to you, PERIOD!

If you want to be great, you will happily lose pretty much _all the time_.  You won't be throwing the match.  That is silly.
You will constantly _play your best_.

So why are you losing?  Or to change pronoun.  Why am I always losing?  For more than a year, I have played tennis and almost
always lost my serve.  I consider it almost bizarre to win my serve.  I do commonly win matches now because certain parts of
my game are so good that they really don't fail.  If I am not serving every other game (i.e. playing Doubles), I actually do win a
fair amount now.  But it is effectively _in spite_ of me failing so much.

Finally, the punch-line.  I fail so much because I am always practicing _my best game_ and this is also commonly _totally new and
difficult_.  For nine months I tried to serve like Federer.  Failed a lot.  By month nine, I had a decent 90 MPH serve.  Not
totally reliable, but definitely decent.  So I had progressed from being a 3-ish kind of player to being a 4-ish kind of player.
Definitely 'made progress'.  Awesome right?!

A week later, my serve was notably "less winning" (you might call it 'worse' but that would be incorrect).
I could barely keep it in the court.  I could barely land my feet properly.  And this was all John's fault... and all my
fault.  Lots of fault to blame the faults on ;-)

What happened?  I was going for a 100MPH serve.  I had a 90, wanted 100.  That required a couple tweaks to my service motion
and it took me a week of practice to get those pieces in play.  When I headed for 120 MPH, my motion was so big that it
took me almost a month of daily practice to get it.  I have it now (the motion if not the 120), and lo and behold today
is my day with John.  And he tweaked me again.

So I am constantly failing and losing because I am _constantly practicing_ the strokes I need _for Wimbledon_.  I may never
go.  I may never make it.  But when I play a game with you, I am treating you like Federer, and playing a game that could
potentially beat Federer.  Or at least the best game I possibly can.  The best game I could ever have given where I am today.

So that is why I fail a lot but also progressed a lot.  Failing to beat Federer is not a particularly bad thing.
