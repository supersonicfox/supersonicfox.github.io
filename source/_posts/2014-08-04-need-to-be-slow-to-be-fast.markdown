About nine or ten months into my transformation, I was hitting serves and ground-strokes at about 90 MPH.  "What!"
Yes, really.  You can ask my partners, but more objectively you can ask my Go Pro Hero.  The Go Pro is a
wide angle, 120 FPS, video camera.  It has other abilities too, but for tennis, this particular mode will
be the most important for you.  If you don't have a Go Pro Hero, try to borrow one from someone, or stop
by my courts and I will tape you.

Again, about ten months in, I had video confirming the 90 MPH speeds.  Of course, if I am serving at 90 MPH the
obvious question is "How do I serve at 120 MPH?"  At least, that is the obvious question to me :-)

<!-- more -->

So I asked my coach John, how do I serve at 120 MPH and he told me to do four new things.  One involved holding
my racket looser, which I actually applied to every stroke.  My racket is floppy in my hands now, significantly
aided by a tacky Tourna-Grip wrap.  But the other three things involved my coiling my body in a way that even
this morning caused me to pant.  Just practicing it involves so many muscles in my body that I feel completely
spent every time I do it.  I now serve beyond 100 MPH, and maybe I reach 120 on a good serve.

But this post isn't about that, it is about the other side of a 100 MPH serve.  It is about being incredibly _slow_
to be that incredibly _fast_.

In previous posts, I mentioned that you are trying to convince your body that tennis is a critical part of
its survival.  That is definitely true, but at the same time, you are not trying to actually _harm_ your body.
It is on your side.  You need to take care of it.  Very good care.

So wear sunscreen :-)

But also recognize that your body is probably not innately comfortable traveling at 100 MPH.  To produce a 100 MPH
serve or ground-stroke, your racket has to be traveling at 100 MPH.  Yes, the racket head is a bit further out than
your palm, but not by that much.  So your palm is traveling at basically 100 MPH (say you now hit 120 with your serve)
and your elbow a bit slower, and you shoulder a bit slower, etc.  But to be simple, lets just assume _everything_
is traveling at about 100 MPH.  That is a lot of speed.  And more importantly, that is _a lot of energy_.

For me, I feel it mostly in the shoulder.  The rotater cuff is a crazy complicated and impressive set of muscles.
Pitching softball a few years ago, I mangled it a bit, but have apparently recovered since then.  But now in
tennis, I am in constant communication with this set of muscles.  I serve at 100 MPH+ and I am asking these muscles
very politely to _keep my arm attached_.  I would like the ball to go to the other side of the court and my arm
to stay on this side.  And I recognize this is no small request on my rotater: that arm is traveling nearly 100 MPH
and those shoulder muscles are keep that arm attached.

The next section may seem "extreme", and if you are under 25, feel free to do whatever you want with your body.
But remember I warned you :-)

So back to our bodies.  You need your body to travel at 100 MPH without tearing itself apart right?  You can do this,
but just do it very slowly.  Using serving as an example, my preparation for serving has been getting slower and slower
as my serving has been getting faster and faster.  I can take me 15 to 30 minutes to be ready to serve now, where before
I would just walk up to the line and wail on that ball.

During these 15 to 30 minutes, I:

   * Toss the ball many times, to different 'quadrants' surrounding my body.  If you looked down from about, quadrant '1' is your front right, '2' is your front left, and so on.
   * Do a tai-chi like swinging of my racket as a continuous motion around my body.  If you hit 100 MPH, you need to make sure you don't need to _stop_ the 100 MPH energy.  The flow of your racket should be able to slowly dissipate the 100 MPH.
   * Alternate tossing the ball and seeing its blur, with swinging the racket and seeing its blur.
   * Do very lazy serves of just one part of the service motion (say a top-spin 'helicopter') but by this point my racket is contacting the ball, so my wrist is feeling it.
   * Practice the three-plus dimensional coil, using the fence to provide resistance and feedback
   * Start a fuller service motion, but don't take it very seriously
   * Take it a bit more seriously
   * Practice hitting balls over the far fence with my 'A' (pure power, most natural flow) serve
   * Then start working through the actual serves

As you can see, the above is not a small list.  By the time I am hitting balls over the far fence, my body is ready for the 100 MPH, but
there are at least six bullets before that.  Those bullets didn't seem very important to me for nine months, but now they are
critical.  I rarely skip any of them, and when I skip some I am trusting that my routine the day before made that skipping
'safe'.

You don't have to have exactly the same bullets as I do, but I definitely recommend you figure out what yours are.  My arm
is still attached to me, and I would like yours to be too.
