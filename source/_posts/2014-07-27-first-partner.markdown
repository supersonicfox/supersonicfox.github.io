I commonly refer to everyone with whom I play tennis as my 'partner'.  I have no opponents, just partners who are either
on the same side of the net, or partners on the opposite of the net.  This may be because we switch up
the matches quite a bit, or because I appreciate their help when we warm up, or just because I am a friendly guy
who does not really want any opponents.  Whatever the reason, that is what I mean by 'Partner': someone who plays tennis
with other people.


If you want to get good at tennis, you need to find a good partner.  And however good you are, your first partner
needs to match your abilities as they are today, and how good they will be in a couple months of serious practice (yes, I
said 'serious practice'... you are serious aren't you?).

That is a tall order for this first partner to fill.  But amazingly, your first partner will be even better than just
this tall order.  Your first partner will be amazingly reliable and incredibly consistent.  If you don't play tennis
today, it was because _you_ chose not to play and get better.  Seven days a week, your partner will be ready.  You might
have to drive a bit to meet up, but that drive or walk is to tennis courts, and given you are a tennis player that
is expected of you.  And you may have to meet up early in the day or your first partner could be busy.

The only real short-coming to your first partner is they don't have much of a personality or ever have much to say.
If you are serious about tennis, you will walk up to your partner 3+ times a week and say "hello".  And every time
they will sincerely say nothing back.  Because they are a wall.

The tennis wall is the ultimate starting partner: it is waiting for you right now!  Grab a racket and even just one ball,
head over to the wall, and start hitting.  See!  It was ready and waiting for you!  You can do the same thing every day
at 6AM when it is less busy.  You can even do the same thing at _3AM_ (depending on the wall's "community rules")
although it can be a bit difficult to see.  I did this just yesterday (seriously!), so I am quite sure the wall is
there at 3AM and doesn't sneak away to play with other walls.  Or at least it didn't yesterday.


If you want to be good or even great at tennis, you have to find your nearest tennis wall (aka backboard),
introduce yourself, and commit to meeting up with it regularly.  If you miss a meeting, it is _your fault_.
You didn't care enough about tennis: it was there and waiting for you.  Maybe
you should make up for it by doubling the routine the next week.  The wall loves company, it just has a hard time telling
you so.
