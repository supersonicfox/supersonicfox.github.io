A donut is when you have won no games.  You have a zero vs. the opponent's who-knows-what.  In normal set play,
your zero is going against their goal of winning six games.  Being 0-5 on your serve is not a lot of fun,
unless you think it is!  And then the only right attitude is: crush or eat that donut!

Today I was playing with a good player, and after a good first set, given work-timing constraints,
we decide to play a 'bonus' four games.
Two for his serves, two for mine.

He went first and I was fiddling/practicing my serve and failed to fiddle well enough the first pass through.
So as of my last service, it was 0 serving 3.  Giant DONUT!  I don't like having donuts, but I don't care about
them today against my able opponent.  I care about them at Wimbledon "tomorrow" when they will be against Federer or Nadal.
Seriously!

So I have this big, giant, gargantuous, donut facing me!  And what do I do?  I serve the biggest, giantous, gargantuous-ness
serves I could possibly do.  My first "second-serve" is an ace!  And through and through, the vorpal racket went snicker-snack.
That game it was on.  No donut for me.

By being prepared to lose, I was similarly prepared to be something better.  Progress through failure.

I could have easily won _any_ of my serves today by holding back, to leverage my particular skills.
But to beat Federer, I have to _progress_.  And today, I did that vs. a donut.  And tomorrow, so should you.

## USTA is a bit clueless

On the same day as the above, I received amongst the silliest emails I have received in my life.

If winning vs. being awesome isn't important to you, just play against a bunch of gophers.  Bill Murray will enjoy the company.  You might
win, but those gophers are quite wiley!
