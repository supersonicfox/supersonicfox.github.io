You may have been playing with your [first partner](/blog/first-partner) for quite some time now... but
have you thought at all about how they feel?  I assume you are playing in some kind of tennisy outfit: shirts and pants, dress,
skirt, maybe sweats, etc.  But all this time your partner has been _naked_ hasn't it?  All this time...

We need to fix that, for your first partner is not at their best when they are naked.  And for you to get
better, you need all your partners to be at their best.  Even if they are Serena or Federer (which would be awesome!)

Your poor naked wall may look something like this:

That is not nice!  At least make sure it has basic attire:

And if you want to really doll it up, get some tagger to help you do this:

##Targeting

Just like you had targeting rackets for your serve, you need targets on the court for the rest of your shots.
We will discuss on-court targeting later, but with the wall, you need reference points and goal targets.  The squares
can serve as both.

The standard way is like the simple red square: use a bit of masking/painters tape to make a square.  It can be big (the red square is a bit big)
or even just a 'visible dot'.  You can have concentric squares, circles, triangles, or whatever shape you love the most.  But
don't hit against a bare wall if you can avoid it.  Get some kind of reference point up there and put up some kind of goal/s.


Now get them targets!
