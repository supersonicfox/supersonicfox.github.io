    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been writing a book <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a> and playing a lot of tennis.  The tennis was a major part of
how I transformed in the last year, and may have been a major enabler for writing the book.  Losing 40 pounds of fat, gaining 10+ of muscle,
and having an insanely fun &amp; social activity may have been major catalysts for my transformation.  The book will cover some of what
happened with tennis, but it has a lot of topics in it, and it is mostly about learning &amp; kindness repeatedly being applied after
repeated failures.  This site and blog will focus just on tennis, hoping to help others be better players, and told from
a somewhat elderly, not super-fit (at the start), but definitely committed player.  Not a professional tennis player, but a professional <em>learner</em> who
applied those skills to tennis.</p>

<p>I hope it helps someone else have a little better (or a lot better) of a game, while still having an insanely fun time playing.</p>
