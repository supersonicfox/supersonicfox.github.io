My coach John is _amazing_! If I had my current mentality plus John when I was 18, Federer and McEnroy would both be scared of me.

John is an insanely positive kind of coach... you can do good, but you can't do wrong by him.  You can just
learn new things that will make you better.  John and I seem to be connected at a level that is a bit unusual, but
his positiveness is not a critical aspect of our connection.  But it may be critically important to you!

One of the critical things to John (IMHO) is that "no shot is wrong, it is _at worse_ the wrong shot at this particular point!".
An example of this idea, is that hitting shots into the double's alley is only "wrong" if you are not playing doubles.  So don't
convince your body that the amazing shot you just hit is wrong _universally_, just remind your body and your mind that you need to
only hit that particular shot in "Doubles!".  Just call "Doubles!" and a "bad shot" has become a great shot!  No, it doesn't
change you single's score, but your body and your mind now know that "That was a wonderful shot!  For Doubles!"

## Into the net

The main area where I and John diverge are "into the net" shots.  Yes, it is _possible_ that in a particular _position_ that
my _into the net_ shot might actually clear the net and do something useful.  Yes, all that is possible.  But I choose to
simply say "No!" when my shots go into the net.  Go long!  That is fine.  I can either be further back or swap in a higher-control
racket.  But I say "No!" when my shots go into the net.

John would likely say "That was good!  Now try this!"  And that is why John is an amazingly better coach than me.
