<div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned previously (<a href="http://SupersonicFox.com/blog/one-grip-to-rule/">http://SupersonicFox.com/blog/one-grip-to-rule/</a>) that there are basically two grips that
can &lsquo;rule&rsquo; your grips:</p>

<ul>
<li> Continental – Conservative grip that works both forehand and backhand</li>
<li> Western – Aggressive grip that works both forehand and backhand</li>
</ul>


<p>The advantage of the above is not needing to change grips per side.  I believed these were the only &lsquo;true grips&rsquo;
until I spent several days with a two-handed backhand.  And then I realized tennis had gotten everything wrong
about one-handed backhands&hellip; since&hellip; whenever people stopped hitting with a Continental.</p>

<h2>The grips</h2>

<p>If you go to any standard grip reference like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_(tennis)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_(tennis)</a>, you will read about
bevels and what the grips are named.  If you start with a Continental, it is on Bevel #2, and the racket is
perpendicular to the ground if you hold your wrist &lsquo;properly&rsquo;.  The description of the forehands are all correct,
but it leaves off the &lsquo;side-effects&rsquo; of shifting grips:</p>

<ul>
<li> As you move to an eastern and then western forehand, the ideal contact point moves toward the net.

<ul>
<li>If you went the other way (Eastern backhand / bevel 1), the contact point would move backward.  This is not a normal shot, but is good in certain stretch pinches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> As you move &lsquo;western&rsquo; the racket is able to whip more and more effectively</li>
</ul>


<p>If you consider these side-effects, you will actually see the insanity that occurred on the backhand and why
one-handed backhands are &ldquo;grip-inferior&rdquo; even when they are &ldquo;flow-superior&rdquo;.  That is why they died.  And by
thinking through the two-handed backhand, I just resurrected them.</p>

<p>Start again with the Continental for the backhand.  This is natural and you hit it from the &lsquo;Front of the Box&rsquo;.  Great
for volleys, and actually fine for top-spin although weaker than some other options.  But for whatever reason
humanity went insane when it decided what to do with a backhand to make it better than the continental (note that a two
handed backhand holds a Continental by default for the &lsquo;forehand-hand&rsquo;).</p>

<p>What humanity did is turn the bevel to #1.  Now consider the side effects mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
<li> As you move to an eastern and then western forehand, the ideal contact point moves toward the net.

<ul>
<li>Our body is turned around, but we are also turning the grip the opposite direction</li>
<li>And I think this should obviously be viewed as insane because it is <em>the wrong direction</em> for spin.  You can&rsquo;t hit spin easily outside the box.  Inside yes, outside, no.  Power yes, Spin no.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> As you move &lsquo;western&rsquo; the racket is <em>less able</em> to whip</li>
</ul>


<p>An eastern backhand is &ldquo;fine&rdquo; and even scary because you go for a bit more power than a continental has.  For all but the top 20 people in the world, it may not matter.
There are lots of other issues people have, so a bad backhand may not be a problem.  And most people now opt-out and pick a two-handed anyway.</p>

<h2>The right backhand grip</h2>

<p>I have both a one-handed and a two-handed backhand.  Recently I spent several days (so about 15 hours) playing with primarily a two-handed backhand.  The goal was to
get more spin on service returns, which I now can drive but not top-spin (flick).</p>

<p>I have the alternative two-handed backhand grip: I combine two eastern forehands vs switching to a continental with my right hand.  The two-handed was better
than my one-handed at spinny shots.  I studied the motion to get it as &lsquo;epic&rsquo; as possibly and it definitely was crazy what I could do with the ball.
But I hate how &lsquo;tight&rsquo; a two-handed backhand feels, and when I switched back and forth I sometimes got the contact point wrong (one handed is net-side of the front
of the box, two-handed is from the back of the box) so that was frustrating.</p>

<p>Finally, one day (yesterday), it dawns on me that I am hitting my backhand with a different right-hand grip.  That in changing to a two-handed, I changed <em>two things</em> (a) my right-hand grip, and (b) having my left hand participate too.</p>

<p>You should never change two things at once: you don&rsquo;t know whether they both matter, they might cancel each other, etc.</p>

<p>And with this revelation, I found the one true backhand we should have been using since the continental.  It is still an &lsquo;Eastern&rsquo;, but it is an &lsquo;Eastern Forehand&rsquo;.</p>

<p> ## Eastern Forehand on the Backhand</p>

<p> I have not found anyone who officially plays with this (before me), but if you run the analysis you can see it is the right thing to do.  First, just
 the macro statement:</p>

<pre><code>* We turned around (left side for a righty)
* We are hitting on the opposite side of the racket
</code></pre>

<p>The two things <em>cancel</em> each other.  The grips should go in the same rotational direction because of this.</p>

<p>Now consider the side effects:</p>

<ul>
<li> Going toward a western forehand (for your backhand) moves the contact point away from the net

<ul>
<li>And into the middle of the box&hellip;</li>
<li>This is perfect for spin!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> As you move &lsquo;western&rsquo; (again forehand for the backhand) you are more able to whip</li>
</ul>


<p>You can actually see the craziness of the original grips when you see a western backhand.  The racket is so out of position, it is basically a weird slice: the wrist goes away from the shoulder (slice) vs. the thumb heading toward the shoulder (top-spin).</p>

<p>No, this is not an easy grip to play with.  An Eastern Backhand is easier.  A Continental is easier.  But the Eastern Forehand is the optimal grip for a crazy spin backhand.</p>

<p>So if you want the spin of a two-hander, first try to progress your one-handed grip clockwise.  If that is too hard for you, then do the two-handed thing.  But maybe revisit the one-handed
later in life.  It might surprise you :&ndash;)</p>
