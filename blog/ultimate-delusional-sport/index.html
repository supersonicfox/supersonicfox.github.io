<div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing the &lsquo;competency thread&rsquo; (see <a href="http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-competent/">http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-competent/</a>), this issue has come much
more to the foreground lately.  Apparently rumors and spectators have taken notice of my insanity and I get people
that visit and watch, or visit and play for ten to twenty minutes, or even those that play with me regularly, who
then chime in about &ldquo;Your just a 4.x&rdquo; or &ldquo;I played with him and I can beat him&rdquo;.  Now until I get my ATP or USTA
official rank, I can&rsquo;t deny these to be possibly true.  But I am pretty sure they are not.  Later I will explain
why it is hard for lower level players to have any ability to recognize a higher level player unless they are <em>very
 open-minded and very perceptive</em>.</p>

<h2>The ultimate delusional sport</h2>

<p>The problem with tennis is that it is basically a &lsquo;small tank&rsquo; sport.  There are lots of little groups of tennis
players who rarely play outside their group.  Do they go to Stockton for that tournament?  No.  Play any of the
opens?  No.  They play in their town or nearby, and they play at the <em>lowest</em> level they can possibly play.  USTA
will kick you up, but not too far.  And worse, they won&rsquo;t kick you down.  So you played 4.0 one year and are a 3.5
now, but still playing in the 4.0 league.  So it is no longer a 4.0 league just from that problem.</p>

<p>Plus, you don&rsquo;t get compared to other 4.0s in the nation.  There is no &ldquo;4.0&rdquo; rank.  It is a level, and it is specific
to your community.</p>

<p>So a lot of 4.0s are not, a lot of people who played in college think they are much better than they are
(thousands of people played in college).
And people who play matches daily think that the time invested makes them amazing.</p>

<p>So lots of people think they are big fish, but they are in a tiny tank, and they are minnows in the real tanks.</p>

<p>This &lsquo;small tank&rsquo; problem affected me when I was young: I played at school and in clubs, and I was &lsquo;good&rsquo; and striving to be #1 on my school&rsquo;s team.
But then two delusion-fixers came through my life: first was a tennis camp from Florida.  Yes, a <em>Real</em> tennis camp for would-be professionals.
Within the first day it was clear that I was not good.  And I worked on trying to catch up to them&hellip;. worked really hard&hellip; and got closer at least.
The second was Patrick who played the 16-under and 18-under tours, and when he joined my high school, the chance of being #1 was
forever stripped from me because he was on a completely different plateau.</p>

<h2>How not to spot a 5+ player</h2>

<p>If you are a 4.x player, you may think you can spot a 5+ player easily.  But there are issues.  For one, a 5+ player
who is playing with you is playing at least one if not two levels beneath them.  This is not challenging.  At least
not if you play it without constraints.  Even with constraints it is still a social activity.  Imagine you were playing
with a 2.x.  What would you do differently?  Would it be obvious to the 2.x who is playing with you that you are a 4.x?
And by playing with a 2.x, I mean <em>all the time</em>.  There are no 4.x to play with.  For this to be fun, you have to
put on various constraints most of the time.</p>

<p>A list of constraints I have placed on myself include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Must play in singles even when in doubles</li>
<li> Must serve my nastiest serve even when it isn&rsquo;t landing properly</li>
<li> Must not kill the net player or anyone who is at net</li>
<li> Must not take advantage of players being out of shape, having no backhand, no ability to return lobs, etc.</li>
<li> Must hit it <em>to</em> the other player vs. away from them</li>
<li> Must not serve the serves that wins against you after I have determined what they are</li>
<li> Must work on all my shots even when most are thoroughly un-needed against you.</li>
<li> Must work on open stance backhands, left handed forehands, incredibly hard shots that can &lsquo;win&rsquo;, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>Up until yesterday, pretty much all of these were in force, and with them in force, I am probably a 4-ish kind of
player (will &lsquo;tie&rsquo; a 4-ish player in one set, likely win in three, and definitely win in five because I am in better shape
and all the above constraints become irrelevant as my game becomes &lsquo;hot&rsquo;).  My game would look &lsquo;weird&rsquo;, but the
score would not.</p>

<p>The next way not to identify a 5+ player is by whether they trounce you.  Sure, they could.  It is kind of fun.
But it turns out it is bad practice.  To beat a 4.0 you need to play at a 4.2.  Against a 4.5, you should be a 4.8.
Voila &mdash; you win two sets straight or at least the tail two sets.  This is the way to consistent winning: run faster
than the other player, not the theoretical Tiger (or in tennis, Roger-Rafa pair) who is chasing you.</p>

<p>Why the tail?  Again, a 5+ player doesn&rsquo;t want
to play against a 4.x except for social fun.  And if you are putting in 30 hours a week, you try to minimize the
4.x time because it is sucking up real practice time.  So it is likely that the 5+ player is not used to playing
against certain shots that 5+ players don&rsquo;t have.  Flat serve.  Not likely.  Slow serve.  Not likely.  Mediocre
topspin.  Not likely.  Floaters&hellip; etc.  Recalibrating takes time.  Ideally four games or less, but that can put you at a
handicap in the first set.</p>

<h2>How <em>to</em> spot a 5+ player</h2>

<p>Now for how to spot.  This is more theoretical (I haven&rsquo;t done &ldquo;blind&rdquo; testing with it), but these are suggestions
if you care.</p>

<p>   1 Are they actually ranked&hellip; (duh)
   2 Are some of their shots quite extreme?  Way more power than seems necessary?
   3 Do they have a lot of different serves?  Or did you see one once that was &ldquo;crazy good&rdquo;?
   4 Do they <em>not</em> have any weak strokes?
   5 Are they sweating?  Or maybe not at all?
   6 Do they spend more time practicing than playing matches?  Have you ever asked?
   7 Are they going to tournaments more than sixty miles away?  With cash rewards?
   8 Do they have coaches and trainers?</p>
