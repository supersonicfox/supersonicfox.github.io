As part of doing <a href="http://insanelyGreatTennis.com/">Insanely Great Tennis</a> for the local pros of Palo Alto,
I came up with the idea of pitching a franchise to <a href="http://google.com/search?q=SharkTank">Shark Tank</a>.  To
pitch a television show, you need a picture of yourself.  I had my standard Linked-In profile, but that isn't really
very compelling.  So I augmented my pitch with my tennis outfits, so it is a good time to blog about them :-)

My outfits came out of two issues:

   * I frequently played tennis after biking (I biked with my kids to school, and then biked some more after).
   * To play tennis, you need [Lots of fuzzy balls](/blog/lots-of-fuzzy-balls)

Through daily dealing with these two issues came my _amazing epiphany_: you should play tennis in biking shirts!  And by _you_, I really mean
_you_... as in everyone.... if you are reading this... go change your shirt... and go play some tennis :-)

Another constraint on my tennis outfits and clothing in general is that I do not want to think about clothing very much.  So
I have suits.  My primary suits involve a red shirt and black pants.  Sometimes I swap in a black shirt.  That is it.
Two choices.  Mostly affected by the contents of the hamper.

Below you will see four outfits, which were initially just one, but broadened somewhat when the second and especially the
third came along.

## The Red Fox

This is the original.  Worn with either a red ("Fear the Tree") or black cap.

## The Frisco Fox

This is a fun augmentation to the Red Fox.  There is a picture of the Golden Gate bridge on the shirt, and it promotes
a good local bike shop.  No one (sane) in or near San Francisco actually calls the city Frisco, but my slightly insane
daughter likes to call it that, so this outfit's name is for her.  The hat is an alien-hat which seems to match the
charm of the city too!

## The Zebra Fox

The above shirts were the top of the heap until this one came along.  Having a shirt named after you is too awesome to
not wear it.  I need to get this in red though.

## The Yoga Fox

This is a fun shirt, but  has just one large pocket in the back, so isn't as good as the ones above for tennis (or for biking either).
This was actually the original "biking/tennis shirt", but it has only one rear pocket, so I now
store it as a dry spare in my bag.  For this outfit, I reveal my (lack of) hair.
