Again, what I mean by 'Partner' is someone who plays tennis with other people.  Your [first partner](/blog/first-partner) is very reliable but
not very communicative or varied.  Given a particular shot from you, they always do the same thing.
So we should augment your first partner so you have a bit more diversity and a bit more social interaction.  But you also want
reliability.  So who should your second partner be?

Ideally, you are in a nice tennis community.  Very social.  Very inclusive.  Not terribly serious.  Lots of tennis being played everyday.  If you
are, your second partner will be a bit better than if you are in a less active or less inclusive community.  If you are in the Palo Alto area, simply go to <http://tennispaloalto.com/> to see what social and inclusive meetups are
occurring near you.  If you are somewhere else, try to find out that information from your local tennis shop, library, etc.

But onward to the 'second partner'.  Who should your second partner be?  It should be _anyone playing_ at the same time as you
who could possibly hit with you.  I am a 5.0, and if you see me serving at Mitchell (I wear red on top, black on the bottom),
please come by and ask to hit with me.  Whether you are a 1.0 or a 6.0, I will hit with you and I will do my best to make
it fun for you and for me.  Similarly if you are a 6.0 or something less, you should be happy to hit with a 1.0 through 6.0 (or Federer
or Serena if either of them stops by).

Hitting precise shots is not easy!  Hitting at 30MPH within the hit range of a 1.0 is not easy.  Pushing the 1.0 to move a little more,
to handle a bit of speed, to handle a bit of spin, and so on, all without making them frustrated, this is true tennis control.

Surviving 90+ MPH ground-strokes is also not easy.  But any _real player_ who claims to be 4.0+ can hit you 30,40,50,60,70,80,90 MPH
on each and every shot.  Or if they can't, they should be _striving_ to do so.  And making the rally fun for both of you.

So whether it is a person serving who could have a real partner (empty courts aren't very communicative either), someone with their
first partner (a wall), someone who's partner recently wandered away and may have some more energy, or a three-some needing a fourth, ... just go ask "would you
like to hit?"  At worse they will say no, and you can either ask someone else or go to your first partner who will never say 'no'.

Some people are jerks.  They will say no when they should say yes.  Some people have different goals.  Every couple weeks I ask
'David' to hit and he always says no.  He apparently uses his first partner to meditate.  It makes me a little sad, but I
understand.  The jerks I don't, but I just let them go.

To be great at tennis you have to be open to improving (even fanatical about it), understanding, and willing to let things go.
