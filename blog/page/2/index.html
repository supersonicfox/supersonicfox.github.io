<h2>Serve &lsquo;C&rsquo;</h2>

<p>Again, the serves are alphabetical on the time that John or I came up with them.  After understanding the ballistic serve &lsquo;B&rsquo;,
we returned to a more normal top-spin serve &lsquo;C&rsquo;.  This turns out to be both one of the most useful serves if you want to &lsquo;win&rsquo;
or just &lsquo;have fun&rsquo; (without blowing people&rsquo;s minds like &lsquo;B&rsquo; does).</p>

<p>Serve &lsquo;C&rsquo; is also amongst the most complex of the serves until we get into the hell range.</p>

<p>To serve an &lsquo;A&rsquo;, your racket comes
up from behind, hits the ball in front of you (quadrant &lsquo;I&rsquo; if you look down on your body <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry)</a>)
and then finishes into quadrant &lsquo;III&rsquo;.  So for a right-handed person the racket ends to the left of your left leg.  At
least to me, this all seems very natural and I can do a butterfly movement all day long where the racket starts in &lsquo;I&rsquo;,
goes down and back into &lsquo;IV&rsquo;, then goes up and back into &lsquo;III&rsquo;, over the top
to hit the ball in &lsquo;I&rsquo;, and then back down briefly through &lsquo;II&rsquo; into &lsquo;III&rsquo;
and then comes back up to the start in &lsquo;I&rsquo; to do it all again.  Part of my warm-up is swinging those butterflies.</p>

<p>If you move the ball more to the left and on top of you, and swing an &lsquo;A&rsquo; you might think you get a &lsquo;C&rsquo;, but that is not a &lsquo;C&rsquo;,
it is just a kind of weird &lsquo;A&rsquo;.  &lsquo;C&rsquo; is really about understanding your rotator cuff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff</a>, which is an impressive and potentially fragile
set of muscles that connect your arm to your body.  If you google &lsquo;rotator cuff&rsquo;, the first entries are about injuries!  So
please talk with a coach before <em>trying</em> anything I am describing.  I am not a doctor!  Don&rsquo;t <em>trust me with your body</em></p>

<p>So how is &lsquo;C&rsquo; related to the rotator cuff?  I will show you!</p>

<p>With a racket in hand, stick whichever arm you serve with straight out from your body.  Like the lower arms of this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci#mediaviewer/File:Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci#mediaviewer/File:Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg</a>.
Now have the racket face upward (your palm forward depending on grip).  The face of the racket should be forward, toward the net.
Now rotate just your shoulder so the racket is downward and the face of the racket is now to facing the fence.  About 180 degrees of rotation.
Do that a few times to get the feel of it.  You can enlarge it a bit to get more than 180 degrees too, but that core 180 degrees
is the core of how &lsquo;C&rsquo; is very different from &lsquo;A&rsquo;.</p>

<p>After practicing sideways, practice the same move with your arm vertical.  The racket starts facing the net over your head, and ends facing the fence and away
from your body.  John calls this a &lsquo;helicopter&rsquo;.  Some other people call it &lsquo;whipping a wet diaper&rsquo;.  This helicopter move
imparts a lot of racket velocity: I can actually serve quite nicely using it alone (back to being &lsquo;to the side&rsquo;).  And
that extra velocity is very effective for producing spin.  Eventually tennis becomes all-about-the-spin: velocities are
so high that <em>going faster</em> will simply <em>go outer</em>.  But <em>spinning faster</em> will stay in and drive people crazy.</p>

<h3>Wrong-side</h3>

<p>OK, so you take an &lsquo;A&rsquo;, add the helicopter, and toss the ball slightly more left and on top of you, and you get a &lsquo;C&rsquo;.  That is
most of the basics of a &lsquo;C&rsquo; except for one major issue&hellip; where does the racket <em>go</em> after you hit that ball?  With an &lsquo;A&rsquo; the racket
went forward and veering to the &lsquo;III&rsquo; quadrant (left of left-leg for a right hander) is natural.  With a &lsquo;C&rsquo; you just flipped
your racket way to the right and quadrant &lsquo;III&rsquo; is no where close.</p>

<p>Well, if &lsquo;III&rsquo; is gone, the only thing left is &lsquo;IV&rsquo;, so that is where you have to finish.  Except &lsquo;IV&rsquo; is where your other leg is!
Don&rsquo;t wack it!  It isn&rsquo;t pleasant!</p>

<p>You need to get that leg out of the way to do a real &lsquo;C&rsquo;, and because of rotational aspects and other dynamics, the best place to put
it is further away (up) in &lsquo;IV&rsquo;.  So the racket goes below your outstretched leg, which gives it enough time to slow down.</p>

<h3>What?</h3>

<p>So &lsquo;C&rsquo; is really quite complex and I probably can&rsquo;t explain it well without photos (maybe later), but I wanted to get
something down on paper to start with.  If you practice the helicopter to your side and above, you will begin to
understand the &lsquo;C&rsquo;.  That is a good start.  Just keep your shoulder attached while you do it :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I have mentioned before, I <em>do not</em> have a second serve.  For nine or more months I worked on a single
serve that was meant to be as close as possible to Federer&rsquo;s flat-ish serve.  That was my model.  I served
it twice.  No second serve, just a first serve served twice.  I failed a lot.  And over time I became pretty
insanely great with that model.  At least insanely great for a 50-year old geezer :&ndash;)</p>

<p>After I managed to have a reasonable serve, which I simply named &lsquo;A&rsquo;, I was willing to consider other serves.
To really get a strong beach-hold on &lsquo;A&rsquo; I ultimately needed a coach (John) and John was very generous with
offering me &ldquo;Other Serves&rdquo;.  Again, none of these are a second serve, they are just &ldquo;different serves&rdquo;.  John
is very scientific and intelligent and pretty much insanely great at teaching people about tennis.  If they
want to listen.  To his insanity.  Which it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Serve &lsquo;A&rsquo;</h2>

<p>So as of about March, 2014, I had one serve:</p>

<ul>
<li> A: Full Power Serve.  Hit relatively flatly, arm finishes to my left, and I am right handed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Serve &lsquo;A&rsquo; seems straightforward, and it is.  But serving is anything but straightforward.  Learning to springboard, learning
to handle any kind of toss, and even learning to toss a fuzzy yellow ball&hellip; all of these things seem simple but they aren&rsquo;t.
So &lsquo;A&rsquo; lets you worry about things other than &ldquo;How do I hit thee?  Let me count the ways!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For quite a while, I refused to learn a different serve because I didn&rsquo;t really get &lsquo;A&rsquo;, so didn&rsquo;t want to be distracted by
something different.</p>

<p>But one fine Friday, I said the fateful words, &ldquo;John, I am ready to learn another serve&rdquo;.  That was the birth of &lsquo;B&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

<h2>Serve &lsquo;B&rsquo;</h2>

<p>My serves are simply &lsquo;in-order&rsquo; alphabetically, but sometimes coincidences occur.  Serve &lsquo;B&rsquo; is also my &lsquo;Ballistic&rsquo; serve.
It is an insane serve from John, and witnessed by me when I said &ldquo;I am ready&rdquo;.  To serve &lsquo;B&rsquo; you have to let the fuzzy
yellow ball fall <em>behind</em> you.  And by behind you, I mean <em>way behind you</em>.  You are still headed forward but that ball is going
backward.</p>

<p>And you are patient right?  You must be patient!  For eventually that ball will be behind you enough to hit &lsquo;B&rsquo;.  &lsquo;B&rsquo; is hit up
into the air and it lands in the service box (if you are so lucky) and bounces&hellip;. and is never to be seen again.  At its best
&lsquo;B&rsquo; leaves the court after that bounce.  One bounce&hellip; one kill.</p>

<p>The crazy thing about great shots is they commonly don&rsquo;t work how you think they do.  To hit a &lsquo;B&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t hit &ldquo;up&rdquo; at all.  &lsquo;B&rsquo;
is among the crazy slice family.  You put incredibly amount of spin on a ball, and because of its position, that spin does
incredibly things to a ball.  As I mentioned, <em>you</em> are going forward.  Ignoring the movement of your racket, as long
as you are going forward, you will impart forward kinetic energy to the ball.  Effectively <em>your body language</em> hit the
ball into the service box.  Now your racket is free!</p>

<p>A freed racket is a marvelous thing, and &lsquo;B&rsquo; takes that freedom to solely produce &lsquo;kick&rsquo;.  The ball lands&hellip; it &lsquo;kicks&rsquo;&hellip;
it is gone!</p>

<p>Returning a &lsquo;B&rsquo; is a different topic, but understanding a &lsquo;B&rsquo; is a gateway to understanding the insanity of &lsquo;slice&rsquo;.  Which
is incredibly awesome!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A simple organization around doing any physical activity is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Form: The maneuvers of your body, muscles, joints, etc. that you use to cary out the activity</li>
<li>Fitness: How strong and fit you are at doing the above form</li>
<li>Timing: How you do things at the right time to be successful (or better) at the activity</li>
<li>Mentality: What you think when doing the activity (beyond Form and Timing)</li>
</ul>


<p>This post is specifically on the third of the above: &lsquo;Timing&rsquo;.  How do you get the right timing for the various
strokes and activities you have in tennis?</p>

<p>In music, being aware of timing is basically innate to both you and the activity.
You can use a metronome to produce a consistent &lsquo;beat&rsquo;, and you can easily
hear the different speeds.  Percussion instruments (which include the Piano), are
the most obvious of all the musical instruments.  And this obviousness almost
certainly makes timing easier (on the one hand) and more awesome (consider a drumline or a great pianist)
on the other hand.  Tennis players do not have the awesome timing of a great drummer.
Or do they?  And if they do, how did they get it?</p>

<h2>Grunt! or Ha!</h2>

<p>The answer to awesome depends on what you think of service returns and rapid volleying.  I will
tend to stay with service returns as I consider them to be the most visibly awesome aspect in
tennis, and I believe I can produce visuals to help describe &lsquo;what is going on&rsquo;.</p>

<p>To start at the beginning, I will start with the simplest of timing.  When do you hit the ball?  How do you know?
There are two good answers:</p>

<ul>
<li> I know because I just saw me hit the ball – I was watching it</li>
<li> I know because I heard the ball hit the racket – I was listening to it</li>
</ul>


<p>Of these, the first is a little more reliable: light travels faster, and background noise does not impede it.  Strangely though,
the route to great timing is more likely based on the latter: our brains are very sound-timing oriented compared to
our vision.  If sound entered your ear/s only 30 times per second, you would be <em>very disturbed</em>.
Your brain doesn&rsquo;t like that.  Your brain works with sound <em>much faster</em> than 30 times per second, and it is
very good at telling the distance between those sounds (that distance-between-sound is basically the definition of &lsquo;pitch&rsquo;).</p>

<p>So although it is import to watch the ball, and your brain does work with the information, ideally you would always
have both &lsquo;I can see it&rsquo; and &lsquo;I can hear it&rsquo;.  If the ball made no sound when it hits your racket, simply make the
 sound for it.  In my case I &lsquo;grunt&rsquo; when I hit a ball at my fullest.  But when I am playing softer, I say/think something
 like &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually think &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; because I have a different word, but John recommends &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; and so I do too.  John is a better
coach than me :&ndash;)</p>

<h2>A! Ah!</h2>

<p>OK, so you watch the ball as you hit it with your racket, and you made a &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; at the moment of contact.  That is kind of the
start to awesome timing, but not really.  There is no &lsquo;time&rsquo; involved, just a moment-in-time.  We need &lsquo;time&rsquo; to get &lsquo;timing&rsquo;.</p>

<p>To get the most basic form of time, you need two moments.  The &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; is the second moment: you hit the ball.  Not much more to do than
that on that current ball (although maybe&hellip;)  So you need the first moment&hellip; the &lsquo;A&rsquo; moment. But let us call it the &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; moment.</p>

<p>So now we have a nice timing pair:</p>

<ul>
<li> Ah!  – ?</li>
<li> Hah! – Contact</li>
</ul>


<p>If the Hah! is Contact, what should the Ah! be? Turns out there are lots of choices&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ah! the bounce</h3>

<p>You can &lsquo;Ah! the bounce&rsquo; before contact.  This is among the most basic (and also the most powerful) &ldquo;Ah! Hah!&rdquo; pairs.
The bounce is basically the last easily determined moment in time before contact.  By getting the feel of the following variations,
you open yourself up to both some interestingly powerful shots (e.g. on the rise off the bounce) and also start
yourself down the path of insane reaction times where the &lsquo;dot&rsquo;s below are ticks at 30 ticks per second or even 120 ticks per second!</p>

<ul>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Hah!&rdquo;</li>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! &hellip;&hellip; Hah!&rdquo;</li>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! &hellip; Hah!&rdquo;</li>
<li> &ldquo;Ah! . Hah!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>If you can get your brain and body to do these variations with a dot representing 1/120th of a second, you can likely return
any professional&rsquo;s serve.</p>

<h3>Ah! the hit</h3>

<p>You can also choose to &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the contact (the &lsquo;hit&rsquo;) of the &ldquo;opponent&rdquo;.  This is way earlier than the bounce, but the big
advantage is that you are now <em>clearly tracking that ball</em>.  You have made sure your brain and eyes are paying attention
and can start moving your body where it needs to move (both feet and hands).</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take this up a level!</p>

<h2>La Ti Da!</h2>

<p>Simply combine the two above with a simple rename</p>

<ul>
<li> La – The Hit</li>
<li> Ti – The Bounce</li>
<li> Da – Contact</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have seen me return serve at my best a few months ago (April 2014), that is what I was doing.  And I could <em>totally crush</em>
many serves that seemed to others to be almost un-returnable.  But bit by bit my &lsquo;ticks&rsquo; became faster and faster and by &lsquo;Ti&rsquo;
I was in position and the &lsquo;Da&rsquo; was sending a decent serve back at the net man (or the space in the center) at a nice 100+ MPH
pace.</p>

<p>Get your &ldquo;Ah! Hah!&#8221;s and your &#8220;La Ti Da!&#8221;s into your head and your game&hellip; and you will become much better very quickly.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t take my word on it.</h2>

<p>Some captures from high-speed video to show the idea.</p>

<h3>Ah! Bounce, Hah! Contact</h3>

<h4>Ah! Bounce</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f3_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Hah! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h3>Ah! Hit, Hah! Contact</h3>

<h4>Ah! Hit</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f2_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Hah! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h3>La! Hit, Ti! Bounce, Da! Contact</h3>

<p>Switching to &ldquo;La Ti Da!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>La! Hit</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f2_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Ti! Bounce</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f3_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Da! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h3>Fa! Toss, La! Hit, Ti! Bounce, Da! Contact</h3>

<p>And to help you beat me <em>now</em>, I use something closer to this as my model.</p>

<h4>Fa! Toss</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f1_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>La! Hit</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f2_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Ti! Bounce</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f3_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>Da! Contact</h4>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f4_w779.png"/></p>

<h4>And the result :&ndash;)</h4>

<p>By the &lsquo;ticks&rsquo; (30 feet in about &frac14;th of a second), this ball is traveling at about 80 MPH to the net,
so above 90 MPH off the racket against a relatively slow serve.  To confirm the fraction of the second,
if you look at the &ldquo;net man&rdquo; (his name is Tuan&hellip; he is <em>very</em> fast), he has barely moved by the time the ball passes the net.
The server has not moved at all between the two frames.</p>

<p><img src="/images/LaTiDa_20140912a_f5_w779.png"/></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The core of the idea is &ldquo;Ah! Hah!&rdquo;.  This enables you to leverage your natural auditory and mental timing capabilities to get
your physical timing right.  Right can be &ldquo;warmed up&rdquo;, &ldquo;match ready&rdquo;, or &ldquo;on a new level&rdquo;.  Try it.  It&rsquo;s insanely great :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of doing <a href="http://insanelyGreatTennis.com/">Insanely Great Tennis</a> for the local pros of Palo Alto,
I came up with the idea of pitching a franchise to <a href="http://google.com/search?q=SharkTank">Shark Tank</a>.  To
pitch a television show, you need a picture of yourself.  I had my standard Linked-In profile, but that isn&rsquo;t really
very compelling.  So I augmented my pitch with my tennis outfits, so it is a good time to blog about them :&ndash;)</p>

<p>My outfits came out of two issues:</p>

<ul>
<li> I frequently played tennis after biking (I biked with my kids to school, and then biked some more after).</li>
<li> To play tennis, you need <a href="/blog/lots-of-fuzzy-balls">Lots of fuzzy balls</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Through daily dealing with these two issues came my <em>amazing epiphany</em>: you should play tennis in biking shirts!  And by <em>you</em>, I really mean
<em>you</em>&hellip; as in everyone&hellip;. if you are reading this&hellip; go change your shirt&hellip; and go play some tennis :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Another constraint on my tennis outfits and clothing in general is that I do not want to think about clothing very much.  So
I have suits.  My primary suits involve a red shirt and black pants.  Sometimes I swap in a black shirt.  That is it.
Two choices.  Mostly affected by the contents of the hamper.</p>

<p>Below you will see four outfits, which were initially just one, but broadened somewhat when the second and especially the
third came along.</p>

<h2>The Red Fox</h2>

<p>This is the original.  Worn with either a red (&ldquo;Fear the Tree&rdquo;) or black cap.</p>

<p><img src="/images/IGT_Foxes3_mlf1a2_w720_redFox.png"/></p>

<h2>The Frisco Fox</h2>

<p>This is a fun augmentation to the Red Fox.  There is a picture of the Golden Gate bridge on the shirt, and it promotes
a good local bike shop.  No one (sane) in or near San Francisco actually calls the city Frisco, but my slightly insane
daughter likes to call it that, so this outfit&rsquo;s name is for her.  The hat is an alien-hat which seems to match the
charm of the city too!</p>

<p><img src="/images/IGT_Foxes3_mlf1a2_w720_friscoFox.png"/></p>

<h2>The Zebra Fox</h2>

<p>The above shirts were the top of the heap until this one came along.  Having a shirt named after you is too awesome to
not wear it.  I need to get this in red though.</p>

<p><img src="/images/IGT_Foxes3_mlf1a2_w720_zebraFox.png"/></p>

<h2>The Yoga Fox</h2>

<p>This is a fun shirt, but  has just one large pocket in the back, so isn&rsquo;t as good as the ones above for tennis (or for biking either).
This was actually the original &ldquo;biking/tennis shirt&rdquo;, but it has only one rear pocket, so I now
store it as a dry spare in my bag.  For this outfit, I reveal my (lack of) hair.</p>

you!</p>

<p>First some context.  In tennis, you need to hit fuzzy tennis balls.  Sometimes you hit the ball where you want it to go,
and the other person hits it back to you.  That is called a rally.  If all you ever do in your tennis life is &lsquo;rally&rsquo;,
my incredible genius is not meant for you.</p>

<p>But in certain circumstances in tennis, you either (a) don&rsquo;t hit the ball where your partner is, or (b) you or your
partner don&rsquo;t really hit the ball well at all.  So if either of these happen to you, you need to either go chasing after
that wayward ball, or have a brother/sister-ball easily available.</p>

<p>I value my and your time very highly, so I don&rsquo;t like chasing wayward fuzzy balls.  Instead I carry sibling balls with
me to stand in their elders&#8217; place: primus, secondus, &hellip; septimus, and onward.  Wait did I just say &lsquo;septimus&rsquo;?  That is
seven right?  Nobody carries seven balls!  Well, except me.  And as of today, I will teach you to as well.</p>

<p>The tennis industry is a bit backward.  Men are allowed to maybe carry four balls, plus one in their hand if they have a
single handed backhand (Hah!).  Women are apparently still meant to torture themselves with various bizarre &ldquo;stashes&rdquo; or
equipment just to carry one ball out-of-hand.  The tennis fashion industry is clearly seriously demented.</p>

<p>So look elsewhere for salvation.  Where?  Biking!  Yoga!  Walking!  All these other industries can make tennis more fun and
functional for you.</p>

<p>If you are a &lsquo;guy&rsquo; (or &lsquo;dude&rsquo; or &lsquo;mensch&rsquo; or an awesome woman who is also flexible with her clothing), you can actually acquire
some Fila or similar
tennis pants.  Later I will let you know what should be under those pants (and no, it isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;underwear&rsquo;&hellip; and no, it isn&rsquo;t
&lsquo;commando&rsquo; either&hellip; but that is a different topic for a differnt day).  OK, so you have pants that can now carry four balls.
Huzzah!</p>

<p>Now for the seven.  Well, actually, the dozen!  Instead of buying a silly tennis shirt, go buy a 3-pocket biking shirt.
These shirts are both totally suitable for tennis, and by having <em>three</em> pockets, they can carry <em>six</em> balls.  Four in the
pants, six in the shirt, and two in your left hand.  With one in play, you have a baker&rsquo;s dozen.
Burdened with a two-handed backhand?  Terrible penalty!  You are down to <em>ten</em> balls plus
the one in play.  A &ldquo;two-handed dozen&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Playing with ten to a baker&rsquo;s dozen balls is a very different experience.  Much more time hitting with your partners.
Much more productive and less chase-y.  And totally
suitable for <em>serving</em> without having the overhead of a ball-hopper.</p>

<p>You are the ball hopper!</p>

<h3>Women</h3>

<p>If you are a woman and don&rsquo;t want to buy men&rsquo;s clothes to get pockets (Tennis industry dementia), apparently LuluLemon and likely
similar clothing lines are happy to provide 2-4 ball pockets in their pants and skirts.  So go buy them and tell your
local tennis shop that &ldquo;I went elsewhere because tennis clothes are &lsquo;obsolete&rsquo;&rdquo;.  That might get the manufacturers attention!</p>

<h3>My Outfit</h3>

<p>I was going to post my outfit today, but I think I will save that for a blog
&ldquo;What does the Fox wear?  The Supersonic Fox wear?&rdquo; ;&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have been playing with your <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a> for quite some time now&hellip; but
have you thought at all about how they feel?  I assume you are playing in some kind of tennisy outfit: shirts and pants, dress,
skirt, maybe sweats, etc.  But all this time your partner has been <em>naked</em> hasn&rsquo;t it?  All this time&hellip;</p>

<p>We need to fix that, for your first partner is not at their best when they are naked.  And for you to get
better, you need all your partners to be at their best.  Even if they are Serena or Federer (which would be awesome!)</p>

<p>Your poor naked wall may look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2509_w1728_q5.jpg"/></p>

<p>That is not nice!  At least make sure it has basic attire:</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2510_w1622_q5.jpg"/></p>

<p>And if you want to really doll it up, get some tagger to help you do this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2509_w1728_q5_v2.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Targeting</h2>

<p>Just like you had targeting rackets for your serve, you need targets on the court for the rest of your shots.
We will discuss on-court targeting later, but with the wall, you need reference points and goal targets.  The squares
can serve as both.</p>

<p><img src="/images/CIMG2509_w1728_q5_v3.jpg"/></p>

<p>The standard way is like the simple red square: use a bit of masking/painters tape to make a square.  It can be big (the red square is a bit big)
or even just a &lsquo;visible dot&rsquo;.  You can have concentric squares, circles, triangles, or whatever shape you love the most.  But
don&rsquo;t hit against a bare wall if you can avoid it.  Get some kind of reference point up there and put up some kind of goal/s.</p>

<p>Now get them targets!</p>

<p>John is an insanely positive kind of coach&hellip; you can do good, but you can&rsquo;t do wrong by him.  You can just
learn new things that will make you better.  John and I seem to be connected at a level that is a bit unusual, but
his positiveness is not a critical aspect of our connection.  But it may be critically important to you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A donut is when you have won no games.  You have a zero vs. the opponent&rsquo;s who-knows-what.  In normal set play,
your zero is going against their goal of winning six games.  Being 0-5 on your serve is not a lot of fun,
unless you think it is!  And then the only right attitude is: crush or eat that donut!</p>

<p>Today I was playing with a good player, and after a good first set, given work-timing constraints,
we decide to play a &lsquo;bonus&rsquo; four games.
Two for his serves, two for mine.</p>

<p>He went first and I was fiddling/practicing my serve and failed to fiddle well enough the first pass through.
So as of my last service, it was 0 serving 3.  Giant DONUT!  I don&rsquo;t like having donuts, but I don&rsquo;t care about
them today against my able opponent.  I care about them at Wimbledon &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; when they will be against Federer or Nadal.
Seriously!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the late summer and fall of my transformation, I encountered a couple problems.</p>

<ol>
<li> I couldn&rsquo;t really practice &ldquo;real volleys&rdquo;</li>
<li> I couldn&rsquo;t regularly practice &ldquo;real groundstrokes&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<h2>Real Volleys</h2>

<p>The problem with &lsquo;Real Volleys&rsquo; is that good volleys are meant to end a point.  Being at net puts you in great control and
great peril at the same time.  If you have control, you must use it.  To win!  Practicing with a friendly human partner,
it is somewhat &lsquo;not nice&rsquo; to end the point every time they hit a ball to you.  It makes you feel guilty, and until you
can hold almost a dozen balls (more about that soon), it makes practice sessions very much about picking up balls.  If you
are playing with a human partner, I recommend you &lsquo;win&rsquo; on the third ball.  Two back to them, and after that you do whatever
it takes to win.  And they do the same.</p>

<p>Trying to do &lsquo;Real Volleys&rsquo; against a wall is not realistic either.  Too predictable.  Hard to tell what shot you actually made.</p>

<p>The ideal partner for &lsquo;Real Volleys&rsquo; is a Lobster!  Or a similar high-end, random-capable, ball machine.  Don&rsquo;t buy a ball machine
if you are 4.x+ that isn&rsquo;t random-capable.  You will outgrow it almost instantly.  Good for kids and beginners, but not for you.
If you outgrow your first partner (the wall), you need a partner with some modest level of braininess.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing with the targeting rackets, we had this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_9222_h1224.jpg"/></p>

<p>Which is meant to make you look at the court a bit differently.  More like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_9222_h1224_mlf1a1.png"/></p>

<p>Whether you are very consciously aware of it or not, if you repeatedly focus on that racket (the square) and serve,
eventually your mind and body will understand all three green lines <em>and</em> the height of the net.
You will know the shape of the target, how to reach it.  Nice little diddies of &lsquo;Over the net and into the corner&rsquo;
will play deep inside your head.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t use this technique, you will likely have &lsquo;randomness&rsquo; issues.  Not random as in ball-tosses being a bit
unpredictable.  But randomness as in you being unable to land things reliably inside that box.  No amazing curves over
the net, or straight down the middle.  You won&rsquo;t know where you are and where your target is.</p>

<h3>The racket is a lie</h3>

<p>If you study the picture a bit more closely, you will realize the racket is irrelevant.  The actual target for me
is that pole <em>behind</em> the racket.  Between baseboard and windscreen.  The racket wasn&rsquo;t there when I served the
other day, I put it there to explain the idea.  The racket is a very temporary crutch.  Use it until you don&rsquo;t
need it, because you have a pole (very convenient) or some less convenient way to target the same location.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that you have <em>many</em> <a href="/blog/second-partner">second partners</a>, it is time to introduce
your third partner.  Unfortunately your third partner is as socially inept as your first, but
it is much better at one thing: giving you feedback on your serve.</p>

<p>Some people do serve to their <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a>, but the information you get
back is not very useful.  And the wall is missing a number of critical things that I and John (my coach)
think you should be learning.  The only advantage that the wall provides vs. your third partner is
balls come back to you, so you don&rsquo;t need very many balls at all.  Later I will solve
that problem for you and enable you to carry almost a dozen balls!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Again, what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo; is someone who plays tennis with other people.  Your <a href="/blog/first-partner">first partner</a> is very reliable but
not very communicative or varied.  Given a particular shot from you, they always do the same thing.
So we should augment your first partner so you have a bit more diversity and a bit more social interaction.  But you also want
reliability.  So who should your second partner be?</p>

<p>Ideally, you are in a nice tennis community.  Very social.  Very inclusive.  Not terribly serious.  Lots of tennis being played everyday.  If you
are, your second partner will be a bit better than if you are in a less active or less inclusive community.  If you are in the Palo Alto area, simply go to <a href="http://tennispaloalto.com/">http://tennispaloalto.com/</a> to see what social and inclusive meetups are
occurring near you.  If you are somewhere else, try to find out that information from your local tennis shop, library, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have two trainers now.  One is my &ldquo;Tennis Coach&rdquo; (John), and one is my &ldquo;Physical Trainer&rdquo; (Steve).  They
are both awesome and focus on different things for me.  John is getting me to play better by mostly focusing on technique,
and Steve is helping me play better and not injure myself by mostly focusing on my muscles and conditioning.  Steve is
relatively new to me, but we have had one evaluation session, and one real session.  So by this point, I can guess where
things are going :&ndash;)</p>

<p>An important thing about trainers, coaches, and mentors, is you have to <em>trust them</em> and <em>do exactly as they say</em>.  You need
to leave your ego at the door.  You are not the coach.  You are not the trainer.  You do not know what to do, or if you are
so sure of yourself, just walk back out of that door.  And stop wasting your money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About nine or ten months into my transformation, I was hitting serves and ground-strokes at about 90 MPH.  &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
Yes, really.  You can ask my partners, but more objectively you can ask my Go Pro Hero.  The Go Pro is a
wide angle, 120 FPS, video camera.  It has other abilities too, but for tennis, this particular mode will
be the most important for you.  If you don&rsquo;t have a Go Pro Hero, try to borrow one from someone, or stop
by my courts and I will tape you.</p>

<p>Again, about ten months in, I had video confirming the 90 MPH speeds.  Of course, if I am serving at 90 MPH the
obvious question is &ldquo;How do I serve at 120 MPH?&rdquo;  At least, that is the obvious question to me :&ndash;)</p>
