During the late summer and fall of my transformation, I encountered a couple problems.

  1. I couldn't really practice "real volleys"
  2. I couldn't regularly practice "real groundstrokes"

## Real Volleys

The problem with 'Real Volleys' is that good volleys are meant to end a point.  Being at net puts you in great control and
great peril at the same time.  If you have control, you must use it.  To win!  Practicing with a friendly human partner,
it is somewhat 'not nice' to end the point every time they hit a ball to you.  It makes you feel guilty, and until you
can hold almost a dozen balls (more about that soon), it makes practice sessions very much about picking up balls.  If you
are playing with a human partner, I recommend you 'win' on the third ball.  Two back to them, and after that you do whatever
it takes to win.  And they do the same.

Trying to do 'Real Volleys' against a wall is not realistic either.  Too predictable.  Hard to tell what shot you actually made.

The ideal partner for 'Real Volleys' is a Lobster!  Or a similar high-end, random-capable, ball machine.  Don't buy a ball machine
if you are 4.x+ that isn't random-capable.  You will outgrow it almost instantly.  Good for kids and beginners, but not for you.
If you outgrow your first partner (the wall), you need a partner with some modest level of braininess.

The ball machine I bought is a [Lobster IV or V](http://www.lobstersports.com/products/Ball_Machines/Battery_Machines_Model_Comparison/el04.htm),
and the random capability of the machine enabled me to get my volleys into shape, and crush me at the base line (back then, not now).
Very cool.  The ball machine sometimes has issues and certain limitations (can't serve to me), but if you can afford it or borrow
it from me, it will make you a better player.

## Real GroundStrokes

The problem with playing against a wall with real groundstrokes is that eventually the equation is not solvable.  Or at least
not 'normal'.  You hit a ball at the wall, and you have to immediately return it!  Like you were teleported to the opposite side
of the net to receive your own ball.  Up to a point, this isn't so bad, but when my backhand 'blossomed', it was _impossible_
for me to return my own shot with that little time.

Again, a ball machine helps with this.  The Lobster can feed a ball every other second, which is quite fast, but isn't the
insanity of returning your own shot.  And you can adjust timing to be whatever rhythm your play level is at.

## Fiscal Reality

I realize that you may not be able to afford a ball machine.  Don't sweat it if you can't!  Eventually your 'second partner' (people)
will be all you need.  I don't use my ball machine _at all_ anymore, because my partner-friends are much better than it.  And
they are quite a bit more fun to play with.  So a ball machine might help for a time, but it is not critical and your three other
partners (who I believe are all 'free') will be all you need.
