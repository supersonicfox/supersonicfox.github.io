Continuing with the targeting rackets, we had this:

Which is meant to make you look at the court a bit differently.  More like this:

Whether you are very consciously aware of it or not, if you repeatedly focus on that racket (the square) and serve,
eventually your mind and body will understand all three green lines _and_ the height of the net.
You will know the shape of the target, how to reach it.  Nice little diddies of 'Over the net and into the corner'
will play deep inside your head.

If you don't use this technique, you will likely have 'randomness' issues.  Not random as in ball-tosses being a bit
unpredictable.  But randomness as in you being unable to land things reliably inside that box.  No amazing curves over
the net, or straight down the middle.  You won't know where you are and where your target is.

###The racket is a lie

If you study the picture a bit more closely, you will realize the racket is irrelevant.  The actual target for me
is that pole _behind_ the racket.  Between baseboard and windscreen.  The racket wasn't there when I served the
other day, I put it there to explain the idea.  The racket is a very temporary crutch.  Use it until you don't
need it, because you have a pole (very convenient) or some less convenient way to target the same location.

Another way the racket is a lie, is that I don't even faintly target the racket (or the pole).  They are a reference.
You target them to say "I acknowledge you are a reference" but with an actual toss in an actual game, they are not
usually a very good target.

### Onto Doubles

You serve doubles in a different location from singles.  For me, doubles is all about 'feeding' my net partner.  I serve,
you return, into my partner, and she crushes you.  Very simple and sweet :-)

But besides the rhythm being quite pleasant, the serve location start and target is different.

We have moved out wider on the baseline, basically to the singles sideline.  And to compensate, we are now targeting
the next pole over through our (totally awesome 1980x Head Professional) targeting racket.  Note that we are still basically
targeting the same 'vector' end.  The corner of the service box.  That may just be my peculiarity, or maybe John wanted
it that way, but it isn't very conscious, it just showed up in the pictures that way.

### Shades of Gray

If you move wider, move the target to the left.  If you are somewhere between center and the singles' sideline, find somewhere in between
the 'known' targets that seems a reasonable trade-off (ratio).

### The other side

Yes, the other side (the advantage court) works exactly the same way.  Have fun!
