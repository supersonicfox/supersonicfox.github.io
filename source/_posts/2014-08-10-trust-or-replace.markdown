I have two trainers now.  One is my "Tennis Coach" (John), and one is my "Physical Trainer" (Steve).  They
are both awesome and focus on different things for me.  John is getting me to play better by mostly focusing on technique,
and Steve is helping me play better and not injure myself by mostly focusing on my muscles and conditioning.  Steve is
relatively new to me, but we have had one evaluation session, and one real session.  So by this point, I can guess where
things are going :-)

An important thing about trainers, coaches, and mentors, is you have to _trust them_ and _do exactly as they say_.  You need
to leave your ego at the door.  You are not the coach.  You are not the trainer.  You do not know what to do, or if you are
so sure of yourself, just walk back out of that door.  And stop wasting your money.

So John tells me to do something, and as long as I _can understand_ what he is telling me: I do it.  There are times I think
John is completely nuts.  But I do his nutty thing.  And 2-3 days later, I realize he is not nuts.  I was the one with a
blocked Chakra, a box, or some other limiting concept in my head (see http://slumsofpaloalto.com/ for background).

After about four months of this, I no longer think John is nuts.  And I do the same actions I did before, with a slightly
less nutty flavor to them.  You can think your coach is nuts, but don't replace them until you think they are _not helpful_.
John is insanely helpful to me.  He will not soon be replaced.

Steve is different in one regard.  Steve doesn't seem to be nuts at all.  He seems completely driven and skilled at making
me into the best muscular and coordination machine I could be.  What Steve tells me to do may seem nuts to other people
("throw this medicine ball through that wall"), but our insanities align and I _want_ to do exactly what he tells me to do.
It seems totally sane to me, so I do it.  He says JUMP, and I say HOW HIGH while I jump as high as I can imagine me capable
of jumping.  And then he shows me how to use a few additional muscles or a better technique and I jump higher.  I will not
be replacing Steve any time soon either (thanks Melinda! and Ashley!).

Again, listen, do, think nuts or not, do more, and repeat.  Or replace.  Very black and white.
