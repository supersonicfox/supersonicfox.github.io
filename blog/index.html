  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am technologically skilled and believe that some technologies can actually make us more effective people.
But it isn&rsquo;t a guarantee, on either the technology&rsquo;s part or the person&rsquo;s part.  I worked for a heath
and wellness company to try to make exercise more fun, I had a &ldquo;running&rdquo; GPS-based tracker for my skating
routine as well as a heart-rate monitor, and I have an unusual number of GoPros.  At least for me,
all of these things are fun for a while and then the novelty and utility wear off.  That seems to be
a common pattern for others as well.</p>

<p>For tennis: a racket, a few balls, and focused practice are far better than any technology I have tried.
Possibly Goliath (a <a href="http://www.sportsattack.com/store/ace-attack-tennis-machine/">http://www.sportsattack.com/store/ace-attack-tennis-machine/</a>) is an exception if
you can&rsquo;t find a partner that good, but the overhead of Goliath is quite high.  In any case, despite the
ephemeral relationship, I continue to try new technology.  And the newest of the new is a very nicely
designed monitor that happens to work with my racket.</p>

<p>Sony finally released its monitor to the states: <a href="http://www.smarttennissensor.sony.net/NA/">http://www.smarttennissensor.sony.net/NA/</a> and as of
a few days ago, I turned mine on.  It is a nice looking device: simple and compact.  It doesn&rsquo;t weigh
very much, and that type of weight on the butt of your racket can actually help with certain advanced
strokes.  As of this writing, I have played with it for several days.  Not all of it&rsquo;s features, but
definitely working through it&rsquo;s core capability.  But in reality, it revealed it&rsquo;s good and bad in
the first ten minutes.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>Very cool concept and presentation.</p>

<h3>My backhand looks like this</h3>

<p>Based on hitting a few backhands the machine said my hitting patterns looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_0275.PNG"/></p>

<p>That is definitely cool looking, and having it calculate &lsquo;spin&rsquo; is definitely a great feature.</p>

<p>For my backhand, I would guess this is actually pretty accurate.  I have a one-handed backhand,
so it is a &lsquo;drive&rsquo; vs. a &lsquo;spin&rsquo;, and getting &ldquo;+5.0&rdquo; sounds about right.  I have Smart-Court numbers
as well, and this all makes sense.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>The bad can be divided into two buckets:</p>

<ul>
<li> The sensor is stupid</li>
<li> The sensor is useless</li>
</ul>


<h3>The sensor is stupid</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, at a &lsquo;professional&rsquo; level of tennis, the sensor is stupid.  At the higher levels of tennis
all shots have a ridiculous amount of spin.  Top-spin, slice, serves, and so on.  The sensor can&rsquo;t actually
read any spins other than top-spin.  It simply gets confused about what the racket is doing.  This makes sense
when you consider what the sensor can easily know and not know.  Extreme slice is caused by a vertically moving
racket.  That looks identical to a &lsquo;smash&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t know which way the racket is facing and what height the
racket is.  And the sensor has logged <em>every one</em> of my forehand and backhand slices as &lsquo;smashes&rsquo;.  Which is stupid.</p>

<p>Similarly, the spin caused by &lsquo;pronation&rsquo; on a serve might look exactly like a driving motion if you don&rsquo;t realize
the racket is facing downward at the time.</p>

<p>Smart courts watch <em>the ball</em> which is always right about how fast and how many rpms it has on it.  So the
sony sensor is simply attached to the wrong thing.  Everything it is doing is a guess.</p>

<h3>The sensor is useless</h3>

<p>So assume the sensor isn&rsquo;t stupid for a particular level of play (3.5 and below).  The real problem is &ldquo;so what&rdquo;?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tennis is not a terribly demanding sport initially, but over time you will be asking your body to do more
and more unusual things.  It is important you can decelerate properly: that is probably the number one
source of injury.  You &ldquo;rip a serve&rdquo; and then stop your serving arm abrubtly, and the jolt to your muscles
will cause all kinds of issues – now or later.</p>

<p>Similarly, you need to do some kind of warming up.  You don&rsquo;t actually warm your muscles / body, but you get
them / it used to what you are going to do.  This can be a combination of &lsquo;stretching&rsquo; (motions that are not
innately tennis motions) and &lsquo;warming up&rsquo; (motions that are but are done &lsquo;more lightly&rsquo;).</p>

<h2>Stretching</h2>

<p>My main stretches are related to serving: I need to make sure my torso is comfortable going the range I ask it
to go on a serve.  I rotate my core as far as I can push it comfortably&hellip; then a little more&hellip; but avoid
anything getting truly mad at me.  Same over my back.  Then I combine the two into a full tennis coil.</p>

<p>I also &lsquo;dance&rsquo; on the court which gets my lower body used to the directional control and motions that will happen
later.  By &lsquo;dance&rsquo; I mean jumping, hopping, side-stepping, cross-overs, shuffles, etc.  Any normal or slightly unusual
tennis move.</p>

<h2>Warming Up</h2>

<p>For warming up, I do all my main motions without a ball, and tosses without hitting them.  It is a total of about
five major motions on each side:</p>

<ul>
<li> Top spin</li>
<li> Lower Slice</li>
<li> Heavy Pronation Snaps (essencially downward)</li>
<li> Pronation &lsquo;mid-shot&rsquo;</li>
<li> Higher Slice (snapping and not)</li>
</ul>


<p>And also the pronation for service.</p>

<p>I do all of these without a ball and work up to medium-high velocities or higher depending on the motion needing resistance
to be safe at full speed.</p>

<h2>Consistency and taking your time</h2>

<p>Whatever rhythm you do on tennis days, be consistent and as thorough as necessary to be safe.
One day I tried to stretch &ldquo;quickly&rdquo; so the game could begin quickly&hellip; don&rsquo;t do that.  Be consistent or your body
will be unhappy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What To Bring</h2>

<p>For the third meeting, everyone should try to acquire a racket that they like reasonably.  If you don&rsquo;t have a racket,
GMS has some you can try.  I also have a few spares that might have the right size grip for you.</p>

<p>We may have time to evaluate rackets: basically the biggest issue is whether they are balanced or are head-heavy.
If you have a head-heavy racket, switching to a balanced racket will improve your game and ability to learn.</p>

<h2>What We Will Cover</h2>

<p>Assuming a larger group shows up, we will start with the two topics from April 13th.  Then go to two new ones.</p>

<h3>Circles</h3>

<p>Tennis strokes are circles. The ball may travel in semi-straight lines or arcs, but to accelerate, contact the ball
with your racket, and dissipate the energy afterwards, several circles are involved:</p>

<ul>
<li> The circle of your arm going vertically (like if you windmill)</li>
<li> The circle of your torso going horizontally (like if you spin around on a point)</li>
<li> More Advanced: The circle of your arm around your elbow (like if you were whisking cream)</li>
<li> Very Advanced: The whip of the racket around wrist</li>
</ul>


<p>A lot of tennis players think and hit linearly, but this is a very dead-end technique.  All the top pros work in circles,
and you should too!</p>

<h3>Serving (Overhead)</h3>

<p>Serving overhead is mostly about putting the ball in the right spot.  This is no minor feat: you have to toss a ball
vertically reliably, and know where you should be tossing that ball.  But once you &lsquo;Get It&rsquo; and especially there
are techniques to prevent you from &ldquo;not getting it&rdquo;, you should find serving into the service box to be relatively
easy.</p>

<h3>Volleys and Boxes</h3>

<p>Volleys are (initially) a notably different stroke from baselines.  This is partially because the time is so short
that just getting the racket in the way (and sturdy) dominates the stroke.  It is also because people normally hold
a continental, so the &lsquo;box&rsquo; of your body has a major impact on contact points.</p>

<h3>Backhands, Boxes, and Flows</h3>

<p>Generally people consider their backhand to be weak, or weaker than they would like.  Whether you have a single-handed or
a two-handed backhand, it can become epic.  But you have to understand &ldquo;Quo Vadimus&rdquo; where you and your backhand are
 going.  Single and two-handed backhands are completely different strokes, so where you are going varies between the
 two, but both can become great shot-makers.</p>

<h3>Fun!  Games!</h3>

<p>For me, tennis is meant to be fun.  Whether you are with friends in Palo Alto or progressing through Wimbledon, you should be
 having a good time.  I will do my best to come up with fun things to do while we learn to play better tennis together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blog entries with the title &ldquo;GMS Tennis&rdquo; are specifically for the tennis team at Girls Middle School.  Others
might find the materials interesting too, but this is a different flow from the main blog.</p>

<h2>What To Bring</h2>

<p>For the first meeting, everyone should try to acquire a racket that they like reasonably.  If you don&rsquo;t have a racket,
GMS has some you can try.  I also have a couple spares that might have the right size grip for you.</p>

<h2>What We Will Cover</h2>

<p>The first meeting will start off with finding the courts and some quick Tennis-related
introductions.  After that, we will likely cover three major topics.</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>Learning timing is a major part of getting good at any sport and
this is especially true for Tennis.  Besides some specific timings to work on, we will also focus on
more general timing-tools which you can use to learn and improve many different tennis strokes.  If you want a quick overview
there is one at <a href="http://supersonicfox.com/blog/la-ti-da/">http://supersonicfox.com/blog/la-ti-da/</a></p>

<h3>Targeting</h3>

<p>A second major part of any sport is &lsquo;seeing&rsquo; and &lsquo;targeting&rsquo;.  This is a more advanced skill, but some of you may
be ready for it now and others can at least start thinking about using the technique in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tennis has much lore that is simply incorrect.  It may have applied when players in the royal court played in England,
but it has nothing to do with modern tennis.  Unfortunately it is still taught and some tennis players will spend
their lives playing &lsquo;not tennis&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Tennis also <em>needs</em> lots of lies.  They aren&rsquo;t really sincere lies, they are short-term &lsquo;fibs&rsquo;.  They make you think about
tennis the right way, but eventually the lie has to be revealed because you can&rsquo;t get better by believing the lie anymore.
When I played in Indian Wells, I encountered one of the lies head-on, and needed to let it go or I couldn&rsquo;t get any better.</p>

<p>The particular lie was that tennis serves are hit &lsquo;up&rsquo;.  You are short.  The net is tall.  You must hit up to get the
ball over the net.  This lie is very much true for a long time in tennis.  At 60MPH it is true.  Without a jump serve
that gets the racket three meters off the ground, it is true.  But as your serve speed and height increases, it is a
lie.  If you could shoot bullets off your racket, you clearly can not aim &lsquo;up&rsquo; or the bullet would never land in the
vicinity.  No, if you are shooting bullets, you must aim &lsquo;down&rsquo;.  Your service motion is &lsquo;up&rsquo; but the angle of your body
and your racket compared to the court must be downward.  Or that ball is never coming down in time to get into that service box.</p>

<p>What angle downward?  Well, right above the net kind of downward.  And the actual ratio is seven-to-one (one meter fall/rise for
every seven meters forward), and the angle is a bit downward at 82 degrees.  So basically your body needs to angle inward a few degrees,
and then you hit &lsquo;up&rsquo; at the ball, but it comes off your racket neither up or even flat, but downward.  If the ball bounces
off the racket differently from 90 degrees, you may have to compensate even more.</p>

<p>The angles are not important, what is important is you can control the range.  You <em>must</em> be able to hit the tape with
your serve and your racket.  Even a few inches below the tape.  Putting all the energy you have into the serve: you are
not de-powering to land this serve.  You can&rsquo;t win Indian Wells by de-powering to fix a problem, you must control your power.  Then depowering
is a timing tool, not a crutch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I landed in Indian Wells after a ten hour commute on Friday, February 27th.  I was expecting to spend the weekend
getting used to the courts and finding people to play with.  Unfortunately, the weekend didn&rsquo;t work out that way,
and this helped contribute to a very rapid demise on my part on Monday.  To continue to perfect my &lsquo;draw&rsquo;, I believe
Chase (the #1 seed, 150-ish in the world) asked to have two matches on the same day&hellip; or maybe someone else in our
subtree did.  Either way, instead of two days to go long (beat #150) or go home, this was all set up for Monday morning
and afternoon.</p>

<p>Arriving on Friday (night) helped me get very comfortable in Indian Wells by the end of the weekend.  I met the people running the tournament on
Saturday, tested out the courts twice (morning and afternoon), found a good local tennis shop, and found food and coffee
to nourish me.  There were two problems though:</p>

<ul>
<li> No other challenger showed up on Saturday to the courts, so I had &lsquo;no one&rsquo; to play with.  I offered to play with a club player, but he apparently got scared of &ldquo;my level&rdquo;</li>
<li> It started raining on Sunday.  I sacrificed some of my Wimbledon balls to the rain on other courts (IW is very protective of their courts), so I got two workouts on Sunday.  <em>But</em> I could not use the ATP balls I bought on Saturday.</li>
</ul>


<p>So when the courts dried just-in-time for my 9AM match on Monday</p>

<ul>
<li> I had never played with the ATP balls</li>
<li> On the IW courts</li>
<li> With a serious player</li>
</ul>


<p>Chase was annoyed by this as well, as he apparently also thought it was a good idea to &lsquo;warm up&rsquo; for a couple hours and
acclimate to the courts you were about to play matches on.  I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed but next time I would be much more concerned.</p>

<h2>ATP Men&rsquo;s Tennis Balls</h2>

<p>As soon as I started warming up with my partner (opponent), I was shocked.  My strokes were missing the court.
I don&rsquo;t mean missing the line&hellip; the ball was coming off my racket with so much energy, I was hitting the fence!
Apparently ATP Men&rsquo;s Balls (women play with more normal balls) are significantly more bouncy/efficient than any
tennis ball I had ever seen before.  So if I was trying for sixty feet, the ball was going seventy.  That is a lot of change.
My opponent was a local (lived there and had warmed up others in the Paribas challenge the year before) and this was &lsquo;normal&rsquo; for him.  He
wasn&rsquo;t particularly amazing (really just one serve&hellip; not super fast or nasty&hellip; decent ground strokes&hellip; no real net
game) but he was definitely comfortable.  I was incredibly uncomfortable.  Not unhappy or angry or anything, but very
surprised.  And unable to adapt.</p>

<p>My normal approach to adapting to a too-hot game are pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li> Swap in slower and spinnier equipment</li>
<li> Try to &ldquo;Go Rafa&rdquo; and spin the ball more, reducing the pace a little</li>
</ul>


<p>The first just couldn&rsquo;t do the trick at all.  It is meant to deal with a couple-feet-long issue, not ten foot long.
And it turns out the first and the second combined approach &ldquo;produce more spin&rdquo; actually doesn&rsquo;t work either with these ATP
balls.  I will describe the issue in another article in depth, but the quick summary is that given the ball efficiency,
more spin was causing more speed at the same time.  Yes, if I hit a lot slower I could do it.  But that is simply death
at this level of play.  I needed to hit at different angles (especially for my serve), and I do not normally adjust
that.  And so I never thought to adjust it at IW.  Must have faulted 75% of the time, where I rarely fault more than
20% of the time normally.</p>

<p>I controlled almost every ball in the match.  And managed to make unforced errors on pretty much all of them.  Well,
actually, I was getting better in the second set, but I was simply &ldquo;too stupid&rdquo; and &ldquo;too slow&rdquo; to adjust in time.</p>

<h2>Preparing for IW 2016 and other tournaments</h2>

<p>So IW was an incredibly efficient learning environment.  I did watch Chase play next to me, so I have some feel for a &lsquo;150&rsquo; player,
and I learned about things that could vary (balls) more than I ever expected, and I learned I need more control points
to adjust within my game.</p>

<p>I brought back the ATP balls I bought on Saturday and have been on the court three times in the last 36 hours with them, and
now I adjust my service angle (how far forward the toss), target the service line on ground strokes more, and am
working on a dozen
other things that may help me with IW 2016 and other professional matches.</p>

<p>Oh, And I plan to study the weather more carefully before I head to a venue :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received the ladder for the Paribas challenge yesterday.  It is basically &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; for me,
so unless I get injured or sick, I have little to complain about.  First, I hit the #1 seed (ranked 151 in the world)
on the second day.  So basically go long or go home.  If I lose, I come back and try to make some money the good old
fashioned way.  If I win, I will have confirmation that I should keep going and the monetary loss/risk is at least
&lsquo;sane&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Second, there is only one match a day.  And for me (at the top of the ladder), those are always in the morning.  So
I can work the rest of the day with a possible practice in the afternoon to keep sharp.  But I don&rsquo;t have to deal
with nasty sun beating down on me.</p>

<p>Finally, there are enough NorCal locals that I can try to get a group of us set up even if I completely blow the
tournament.  I have given myself &lsquo;two seasons&rsquo; to make something happen or to ramp back down.  If I blow Indian Wells
this year, I get one more try.  The ultimate failer sport :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing the &lsquo;competency thread&rsquo; (see <a href="http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-competent/">http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-competent/</a>), this issue has come much
more to the foreground lately.  Apparently rumors and spectators have taken notice of my insanity and I get people
that visit and watch, or visit and play for ten to twenty minutes, or even those that play with me regularly, who
then chime in about &ldquo;Your just a 4.x&rdquo; or &ldquo;I played with him and I can beat him&rdquo;.  Now until I get my ATP or USTA
official rank, I can&rsquo;t deny these to be possibly true.  But I am pretty sure they are not.  Later I will explain
why it is hard for lower level players to have any ability to recognize a higher level player unless they are <em>very
 open-minded and very perceptive</em>.</p>

<h2>The ultimate delusional sport</h2>

<p>The problem with tennis is that it is basically a &lsquo;small tank&rsquo; sport.  There are lots of little groups of tennis
players who rarely play outside their group.  Do they go to Stockton for that tournament?  No.  Play any of the
opens?  No.  They play in their town or nearby, and they play at the <em>lowest</em> level they can possibly play.  USTA
will kick you up, but not too far.  And worse, they won&rsquo;t kick you down.  So you played 4.0 one year and are a 3.5
now, but still playing in the 4.0 league.  So it is no longer a 4.0 league just from that problem.</p>

<p>Plus, you don&rsquo;t get compared to other 4.0s in the nation.  There is no &ldquo;4.0&rdquo; rank.  It is a level, and it is specific
to your community.</p>

<p>So a lot of 4.0s are not, a lot of people who played in college think they are much better than they are
(thousands of people played in college).
And people who play matches daily think that the time invested makes them amazing.</p>

<p>So lots of people think they are big fish, but they are in a tiny tank, and they are minnows in the real tanks.</p>

<p>This &lsquo;small tank&rsquo; problem affected me when I was young: I played at school and in clubs, and I was &lsquo;good&rsquo; and striving to be #1 on my school&rsquo;s team.
But then two delusion-fixers came through my life: first was a tennis camp from Florida.  Yes, a <em>Real</em> tennis camp for would-be professionals.
Within the first day it was clear that I was not good.  And I worked on trying to catch up to them&hellip;. worked really hard&hellip; and got closer at least.
The second was Patrick who played the 16-under and 18-under tours, and when he joined my high school, the chance of being #1 was
forever stripped from me because he was on a completely different plateau.</p>

<h2>How not to spot a 5+ player</h2>

<p>If you are a 4.x player, you may think you can spot a 5+ player easily.  But there are issues.  For one, a 5+ player
who is playing with you is playing at least one if not two levels beneath them.  This is not challenging.  At least
not if you play it without constraints.  Even with constraints it is still a social activity.  Imagine you were playing
with a 2.x.  What would you do differently?  Would it be obvious to the 2.x who is playing with you that you are a 4.x?
And by playing with a 2.x, I mean <em>all the time</em>.  There are no 4.x to play with.  For this to be fun, you have to
put on various constraints most of the time.</p>

<p>A list of constraints I have placed on myself include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Must play in singles even when in doubles</li>
<li> Must serve my nastiest serve even when it isn&rsquo;t landing properly</li>
<li> Must not kill the net player or anyone who is at net</li>
<li> Must not take advantage of players being out of shape, having no backhand, no ability to return lobs, etc.</li>
<li> Must hit it <em>to</em> the other player vs. away from them</li>
<li> Must not serve the serves that wins against you after I have determined what they are</li>
<li> Must work on all my shots even when most are thoroughly un-needed against you.</li>
<li> Must work on open stance backhands, left handed forehands, incredibly hard shots that can &lsquo;win&rsquo;, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>Up until yesterday, pretty much all of these were in force, and with them in force, I am probably a 4-ish kind of
player (will &lsquo;tie&rsquo; a 4-ish player in one set, likely win in three, and definitely win in five because I am in better shape
and all the above constraints become irrelevant as my game becomes &lsquo;hot&rsquo;).  My game would look &lsquo;weird&rsquo;, but the
score would not.</p>

<p>The next way not to identify a 5+ player is by whether they trounce you.  Sure, they could.  It is kind of fun.
But it turns out it is bad practice.  To beat a 4.0 you need to play at a 4.2.  Against a 4.5, you should be a 4.8.
Voila &mdash; you win two sets straight or at least the tail two sets.  This is the way to consistent winning: run faster
than the other player, not the theoretical Tiger (or in tennis, Roger-Rafa pair) who is chasing you.</p>

<p>Why the tail?  Again, a 5+ player doesn&rsquo;t want
to play against a 4.x except for social fun.  And if you are putting in 30 hours a week, you try to minimize the
4.x time because it is sucking up real practice time.  So it is likely that the 5+ player is not used to playing
against certain shots that 5+ players don&rsquo;t have.  Flat serve.  Not likely.  Slow serve.  Not likely.  Mediocre
topspin.  Not likely.  Floaters&hellip; etc.  Recalibrating takes time.  Ideally four games or less, but that can put you at a
handicap in the first set.</p>

<h2>How <em>to</em> spot a 5+ player</h2>

<p>Now for how to spot.  This is more theoretical (I haven&rsquo;t done &ldquo;blind&rdquo; testing with it), but these are suggestions
if you care.</p>

<p>   1 Are they actually ranked&hellip; (duh)
   2 Are some of their shots quite extreme?  Way more power than seems necessary?
   3 Do they have a lot of different serves?  Or did you see one once that was &ldquo;crazy good&rdquo;?
   4 Do they <em>not</em> have any weak strokes?
   5 Are they sweating?  Or maybe not at all?
   6 Do they spend more time practicing than playing matches?  Have you ever asked?
   7 Are they going to tournaments more than sixty miles away?  With cash rewards?
   8 Do they have coaches and trainers?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the biggest issues I have with winning Indian Wells is that I will be playing against people that
are significantly better than people I play against now.  Tennis, like almost all sports, does not involve your
conscious brain during play.  Or very little of it.  Tennis play is dominated by sub-second reactions.  With
balls traveling at 120 MPH, they are traveling at 2 MPM or 10000 FPM, and finally about 160 FPS.  Although
not this regular, you can think of a tennis court as being divided into four 20-foot sections from end to end.
So baseline to baseline is a half a second.  Net to baseline is a quarter of a second.  Baseline to service is
three eights of a second.  Yes, the times are a little longer as speeds go down, but no matter what you
are sub-second at the professional levels except for defensive lobs.</p>

<p>A half a second is not a useful amount of time to think about something.  You must be leveraging your reactions to something similar
that you have seen before and let your body take over.</p>

<p>When I did a tournament at Stockton, I encountered something I hadn&rsquo;t seen for more than thirty years.  A good
left-handed player.  His shots weren&rsquo;t faster than anything I had seen before.  His serve wasn&rsquo;t stronger.  But
everything was &ldquo;off&rdquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t get my game together against him.  There are a number of causes for this, but
certainly one was that his spins were just &lsquo;different&rsquo; and I was not subconsciously used to them.</p>

<p>So to get ready for Indian Wells, John was nice enough to serve left-handed to me.  And I have an insanely great
ball machine that can serve left handed too.  With exactly four weeks to go, we will see if I can level up
by day-1.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished discussing the way of the devil with the hell (H) serve.  There are actually a number of serves after the hell serve,
but instead of boring you with lots of serve motion variations, I will bore you with lots of ball positions.  As
I get ready for Indian Wells, I am losing serves.  Most professional tennis players have incredibly dangerous forehands.
You should not hit to them.  Nasty Slice Serve?  Yes, that sets up for a perfect death stroke to your left or right as the right-hander&rsquo;s
forehand picks and chooses.  What rattles a 4.0 and below does not rattle a 6.0 and above.  They will be there and
if they are there with a clean forehand, you have just lost the point.</p>

<p>So, some of my serves like &lsquo;E&rsquo; are gone.  And doing an &lsquo;H&rsquo; on the ad-side is gone.  And my &lsquo;A&rsquo; was always a practice serve.
And a wide &lsquo;C&rsquo; serve on the deuce side is gone.  Overall, I lost about four out of eight primary serves.  If the
opponent is a lefty, I switch some of the losses and end up back at four.  Four serves isn&rsquo;t a lot of serves.
Even if my hell serve, my wide &lsquo;C&rsquo; on ad, and my J1 serve are on the mark every time, my opponent would just get
used to them.  This is not a good thing.</p>

<p>But then John steps in and levels me up.  Serves have a motion, and that motion is usually most easily understood
when you toss the ball in a particular place.  The hell serve is in front and directly above my head.  Slice is way
to the right.  Loopy topspin falls behind me.  But learning a serve motion and using a serve motion are not the same
things.  As soon as you have learned the serve motion, you can use it in many different ball toss situations.  John (and
now I) divide the world into 5+ locations.  Three is above your head.  Two is headed toward your serving arm.  And one
is almost parallel to your head and wider than your shoulder on your serving arm&rsquo;s side. Four and five are basically the
same going away from your serving arm.  And six pushes that even further.</p>

<p>So if I just fell to four good service motions, I now have 3 or 4 ball tosses I can use with each.  And each produces a different
behaved ball.  3H vs. 2H vs. 4H are all different.  2J1, 3J1, 3J2, and 4J2 are all different.  And now that I have
enough variations, I can even keep you honest and throw in a forehand attack.  It might be rare, but you slide or
expect too much, and a 4H or 3E to your forehand will do something very interesting.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t normally use a change-up: where I put different amounts of energy into the serve for timing confusion.
But with sixteen serves, they naturally change up on their own.  And I can always work on that next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a year and a half ago I stopped using my first partner (see <a href="http://supersonicfox.com/blog/first-partner">http://supersonicfox.com/blog/first-partner</a>).
Based on a progression of getting more and more powerful strokes, having a decent ball machine, and having good
people to play with, the wall became obsolete.  I was to never need it again.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>As of last Friday, I now go to the tennis courts twice a day.  I need to get used to Palm Springs weather, I need
to get used to playing twice a day, and I need to practice more just generally.  This is now approaching forty hours
a week, but that is just like any other profession.  It is just strange that you practice a lot (without any monetary
gain) and then compete a little with potentially huge monetary gains.  It makes sense: it is a show.  Just not
like any job I was previously familiar with.</p>

<p>Well, the problem with going to the courts in the middle of the day is that lots of people are on the courts.  So
getting court time is difficult, at least on the weekend.  I visited the courts three days, and on no day did a
court open up.  But luckily the wall was still there.  And it didn&rsquo;t seem mad I had ignored it for more than a year.
I had to have time to myself to get back into the relationship.</p>

<h2>The insanity of a wall</h2>

<p>Hitting against a wall at slower speeds and spins works fine.  At higher speeds, topspin flies upward and underspin
shoots downward.  That would be OK and realistic if it was from the bounce on the ground, but it is actually happening
on the bounce on the wall.  Enough topspin and your ball can hit high on the fence behind you where on court it would
curve inside the baseline.  There is basically nothing you can do about this with a normal wall or likely any other
bouncy surface: having an object in the way is not realistic.  Unless you imagine it is a volley.  Now that makes
sense: volley back from drive.</p>

<p>The second insanity is that the ball comes back way too early and likely too fast.  But again, imagine volley and
the world makes more sense.</p>

<h2>Learning through insanity</h2>

<p>So if the wall is a bit insane, does that make it useless?  No.  But as your racket speeds up, you need to
realize what shots you can really play.  For a couple weeks of returning to the wall, I would do &ldquo;Offense-Defense&rdquo;
hitting.  One shot was a drive, and the next shot was a &lsquo;flick&rsquo; to keep the ball in play.  As I learned to have
more and more compact (but heavy) shots, I could even do &ldquo;Drive-Drive&rdquo; combos.  But that took dozens of hours to
get to the point.</p>

<p>In any case, if you can set up the two ball sequences you have a highly effective and productive environment
to learn within.  No chasing after wayward balls, and no being nice to your partners.  Walls aren&rsquo;t very demanding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I registered for Indian Wells ATP challenger tournament.  If I make it through the challenger, I go through a
qualifier tournament.  If I make it through the qualifier, I get into the main tournament, where Roger and Rafa
will be &ldquo;waiting&rdquo;.  If I beat all of my side of the ladder, I will have either beaten  Roger and Rafa, or will have
beaten the people that beat these Tennis giants.  I will also make quite a bit of money and likely make a bit of news.</p>

<p>I expect to win it all, so this year may be a pretty notable year in my life.</p>

<p>If you have read my writings here and there, you may realize I am not a normal person.  My expectations are lofty,
my abilities bizarre, and my life either a dreamy heaven or a living hell depending on how you look at it.  A lot
of me is not transferable.  You can&rsquo;t just be me.  But this one aspect of me, you can take to yourself like the
transfer of the Olympic flame.  You should expect great things.  From yourself.  And then do your best to make
those great things happen.</p>

<p>I am not sure how those words ring on your ears: &ldquo;You should expect great things.  From yourself.
And then do your best to make those great things happen.&rdquo;  My guess is that you just kept reading along.  But
I didn&rsquo;t write those three sentences for you to read them and move along.  They are a torch.  They are fire.
You should read and repeat them.  Aloud.  Like a Koan.  I will even change the pronoun and structure to make that easier: &ldquo;I
expect {something great} from myself.  And I am now doing {all the things that requires} to make that happen&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This phrase is far more powerful than a New Years resolution.  Because although it could be lofty in its expectation,
it is grounded in its action.  &ldquo;I expect to win Indian Wells, and beat Roger and Rafa.  So I am now playing tennis
forty hours a week in weather similar to Indian Wells&rdquo;.  I am prepared to not win Indian Wells, but I expect to win or
why am I going down there?  I am going to do everything <em>now</em> that I could possibly do to prepare <em>now</em> to win <em>now</em>, or
again, why am I going down there?  If I am under-prepared&hellip; then I need to get prepared&hellip; or i shouldn&rsquo;t go into the
jungle.</p>

<p>This one thought is the difference between professionals and the rest: a true professional expects to <em>win now</em>,
to <em>do now</em>, and is <em>preparing now</em> for what their profession requires.  A professional is a soldier.  Without the
downside.</p>

<time datetime="2014-12-31T20:40:00-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 31<span>st</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned previously (<a href="http://SupersonicFox.com/blog/one-grip-to-rule/">http://SupersonicFox.com/blog/one-grip-to-rule/</a>) that there are basically two grips that
can &lsquo;rule&rsquo; your grips:</p>

<ul>
<li> Continental – Conservative grip that works both forehand and backhand</li>
<li> Western – Aggressive grip that works both forehand and backhand</li>
</ul>


<p>The advantage of the above is not needing to change grips per side.  I believed these were the only &lsquo;true grips&rsquo;
until I spent several days with a two-handed backhand.  And then I realized tennis had gotten everything wrong
about one-handed backhands&hellip; since&hellip; whenever people stopped hitting with a Continental.</p>

<h2>The grips</h2>

<p>If you go to any standard grip reference like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_(tennis)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_(tennis)</a>, you will read about
bevels and what the grips are named.  If you start with a Continental, it is on Bevel #2, and the racket is
perpendicular to the ground if you hold your wrist &lsquo;properly&rsquo;.  The description of the forehands are all correct,
but it leaves off the &lsquo;side-effects&rsquo; of shifting grips:</p>

<ul>
<li> As you move to an eastern and then western forehand, the ideal contact point moves toward the net.

<ul>
<li>If you went the other way (Eastern backhand / bevel 1), the contact point would move backward.  This is not a normal shot, but is good in certain stretch pinches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> As you move &lsquo;western&rsquo; the racket is able to whip more and more effectively</li>
</ul>


<p>If you consider these side-effects, you will actually see the insanity that occurred on the backhand and why
one-handed backhands are &ldquo;grip-inferior&rdquo; even when they are &ldquo;flow-superior&rdquo;.  That is why they died.  And by
thinking through the two-handed backhand, I just resurrected them.</p>

<p>Start again with the Continental for the backhand.  This is natural and you hit it from the &lsquo;Front of the Box&rsquo;.  Great
for volleys, and actually fine for top-spin although weaker than some other options.  But for whatever reason
humanity went insane when it decided what to do with a backhand to make it better than the continental (note that a two
handed backhand holds a Continental by default for the &lsquo;forehand-hand&rsquo;).</p>

<p>What humanity did is turn the bevel to #1.  Now consider the side effects mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
<li> As you move to an eastern and then western forehand, the ideal contact point moves toward the net.

<ul>
<li>Our body is turned around, but we are also turning the grip the opposite direction</li>
<li>And I think this should obviously be viewed as insane because it is <em>the wrong direction</em> for spin.  You can&rsquo;t hit spin easily outside the box.  Inside yes, outside, no.  Power yes, Spin no.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> As you move &lsquo;western&rsquo; the racket is <em>less able</em> to whip</li>
</ul>


<p>An eastern backhand is &ldquo;fine&rdquo; and even scary because you go for a bit more power than a continental has.  For all but the top 20 people in the world, it may not matter.
There are lots of other issues people have, so a bad backhand may not be a problem.  And most people now opt-out and pick a two-handed anyway.</p>

<h2>The right backhand grip</h2>

<p>I have both a one-handed and a two-handed backhand.  Recently I spent several days (so about 15 hours) playing with primarily a two-handed backhand.  The goal was to
get more spin on service returns, which I now can drive but not top-spin (flick).</p>

<p>I have the alternative two-handed backhand grip: I combine two eastern forehands vs switching to a continental with my right hand.  The two-handed was better
than my one-handed at spinny shots.  I studied the motion to get it as &lsquo;epic&rsquo; as possibly and it definitely was crazy what I could do with the ball.
But I hate how &lsquo;tight&rsquo; a two-handed backhand feels, and when I switched back and forth I sometimes got the contact point wrong (one handed is net-side of the front
of the box, two-handed is from the back of the box) so that was frustrating.</p>

<p>Finally, one day (yesterday), it dawns on me that I am hitting my backhand with a different right-hand grip.  That in changing to a two-handed, I changed <em>two things</em> (a) my right-hand grip, and (b) having my left hand participate too.</p>

<p>You should never change two things at once: you don&rsquo;t know whether they both matter, they might cancel each other, etc.</p>

<p>And with this revelation, I found the one true backhand we should have been using since the continental.  It is still an &lsquo;Eastern&rsquo;, but it is an &lsquo;Eastern Forehand&rsquo;.</p>

<p> ## Eastern Forehand on the Backhand</p>

<p> I have not found anyone who officially plays with this (before me), but if you run the analysis you can see it is the right thing to do.  First, just
 the macro statement:</p>

<pre><code>* We turned around (left side for a righty)
* We are hitting on the opposite side of the racket
</code></pre>

<p>The two things <em>cancel</em> each other.  The grips should go in the same rotational direction because of this.</p>

<p>Now consider the side effects:</p>

<ul>
<li> Going toward a western forehand (for your backhand) moves the contact point away from the net

<ul>
<li>And into the middle of the box&hellip;</li>
<li>This is perfect for spin!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> As you move &lsquo;western&rsquo; (again forehand for the backhand) you are more able to whip</li>
</ul>


<p>You can actually see the craziness of the original grips when you see a western backhand.  The racket is so out of position, it is basically a weird slice: the wrist goes away from the shoulder (slice) vs. the thumb heading toward the shoulder (top-spin).</p>

<p>No, this is not an easy grip to play with.  An Eastern Backhand is easier.  A Continental is easier.  But the Eastern Forehand is the optimal grip for a crazy spin backhand.</p>

<p>So if you want the spin of a two-hander, first try to progress your one-handed grip clockwise.  If that is too hard for you, then do the two-handed thing.  But maybe revisit the one-handed
later in life.  It might surprise you :&ndash;)</p>

<p>How I manage this is that tennis normally ends by about 8AM, or sometimes 9:30AM on Saturdays.  But
I have to put in about 20-30 hours a week to keep my game at the level it is.  That is at least three hours
a day, so I have to start about 5AM every day.</p>

<p>There are some flaws with starting at 5AM.  First, it is quite dark.  The sun is rising at almost 7AM now, so
that is two hours of no sun.  At 6AM I can turn on the lights, so I work out for about an hour without much light.
A street lamp lights part of the court, and your eyes adjust to the dark.</p>

<p>The second flaw is that although I can turn on lights, I can not turn on the heat lamps.  Because there aren&rsquo;t any
heat lamps to turn on.  California is pretty temperate by the coast line, so this isn&rsquo;t a big deal most of the year,
but today was &lsquo;notable&rsquo;:</p>

<h3>There is no bad weather</h3>

<p>I believe in the maxim &ldquo;There is no bad weather, just bad clothing&rdquo;, so when I see those numbers on my dashboard I
do the obvious thing: &ldquo;Winter Up!&rdquo;.  Seeing freezing temperatures when thinking &lsquo;Tennis&rsquo; does not elicit particularly
useful images.  But thinking &lsquo;Winter Sport&rsquo; conjures images of downhill and cross-country skiers, Iditarod sled-teams, and
outdoor speed skaters.  These people can handle the weather, so why can&rsquo;t I?</p>

<p>Due to my ZAST training, handling these temperatures for tennis only required a single piece of equipment.  I already
had Patagonia skiing outer shells, which are fine at about freezing.  A bit colder and I will need a few more heating layers under it.  I have
two-layer gloves/mittens, which can keep my left hand warm-ish.  The only problem was the racket-holding right-hand.</p>

<p>Fortunately, while I was in the local tennis shop (<a href="http://TennisTownAndCountry.com/">http://TennisTownAndCountry.com/</a>),
I asked about gloves, but was redirected to consider a warm &lsquo;tube&rsquo;.  Your
hand goes in one end, and the racket another.  You meet in the secretive and warmer tube-world.</p>

<p>Yes, shifting grips is a bit difficult.  Especially if you play with the super-tacky grip I play with.  But warming
up I don&rsquo;t shift grips that much anyway, so this aligns pretty well: any given morning I am full of hope that I can
take the tube thing off before I have to switch grips on the fly!</p>
