<div class="entry-content"><p>About a year and a half ago I stopped using my first partner (see <a href="http://supersonicfox.com/blog/first-partner">http://supersonicfox.com/blog/first-partner</a>).
Based on a progression of getting more and more powerful strokes, having a decent ball machine, and having good
people to play with, the wall became obsolete.  I was to never need it again.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>As of last Friday, I now go to the tennis courts twice a day.  I need to get used to Palm Springs weather, I need
to get used to playing twice a day, and I need to practice more just generally.  This is now approaching forty hours
a week, but that is just like any other profession.  It is just strange that you practice a lot (without any monetary
gain) and then compete a little with potentially huge monetary gains.  It makes sense: it is a show.  Just not
like any job I was previously familiar with.</p>

<p>Well, the problem with going to the courts in the middle of the day is that lots of people are on the courts.  So
getting court time is difficult, at least on the weekend.  I visited the courts three days, and on no day did a
court open up.  But luckily the wall was still there.  And it didn&rsquo;t seem mad I had ignored it for more than a year.
I had to have time to myself to get back into the relationship.</p>

<h2>The insanity of a wall</h2>

<p>Hitting against a wall at slower speeds and spins works fine.  At higher speeds, topspin flies upward and underspin
shoots downward.  That would be OK and realistic if it was from the bounce on the ground, but it is actually happening
on the bounce on the wall.  Enough topspin and your ball can hit high on the fence behind you where on court it would
curve inside the baseline.  There is basically nothing you can do about this with a normal wall or likely any other
bouncy surface: having an object in the way is not realistic.  Unless you imagine it is a volley.  Now that makes
sense: volley back from drive.</p>

<p>The second insanity is that the ball comes back way too early and likely too fast.  But again, imagine volley and
the world makes more sense.</p>

<h2>Learning through insanity</h2>

<p>So if the wall is a bit insane, does that make it useless?  No.  But as your racket speeds up, you need to
realize what shots you can really play.  For a couple weeks of returning to the wall, I would do &ldquo;Offense-Defense&rdquo;
hitting.  One shot was a drive, and the next shot was a &lsquo;flick&rsquo; to keep the ball in play.  As I learned to have
more and more compact (but heavy) shots, I could even do &ldquo;Drive-Drive&rdquo; combos.  But that took dozens of hours to
get to the point.</p>

<p>In any case, if you can set up the two ball sequences you have a highly effective and productive environment
to learn within.  No chasing after wayward balls, and no being nice to your partners.  Walls aren&rsquo;t very demanding.</p>
